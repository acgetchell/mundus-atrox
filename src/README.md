# Introduction

Mundus Atrox is a campaign for Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition.

It is a high-magic world driven by extreme climate and geography, with elements of steampunk and indicatons of a techno-magical collapse of civilization in ancient times.

Dwarves and Gnomes hunker down in their mines, Humans flee the worst in their mobile cities, and Elves chase the Perpetual Spring in their flying castles.

The land and seas are dotted with ancient *Artifacts* ranging in size from a marble to a lost city. Their effects vary from mundane to world-altering, with size little clue to their potency.

The search for these items, and encounters with mythical races and guardians, often become the catalyst for adventure.
