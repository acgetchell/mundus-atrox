The party finally makes it to *Phandalin*. *Sildar* leads the group to the *Stonehill Inn*, where they set about procuring lodgings. *Sildar* pays the
party the 50 gold pieces and sets off in search of his friend, *Iarno Glasstaff*.

The group then drops off the supplies to *Barthen's Provisions*, where they get paid and briefly chat with *Barthen*.

*Yeemik* the Goblin is causing a bit of a stir, so they head to the *Townmaster's Hall* next, where they encounter *Harbin Wester* and his group of *Dwarven Mercenaries*. *Harbin* offers them the use of the jail in the basement, and after a few tense moments with the Dwarves *CoralKing* decides
to stay with *Yeemik* to ensure no shenanigans.

*Harbin* offers a bounty of 100gp if the party will clear out the Orcs harrassing travelers on the *Triboar Trail* to the east. The group considers it. *Geral* asks where a healer might be found and *Harbin* replies that someone occasionally tends the *Shrine of Luck*.

No one is at the *Shrine of Luck*, so *Tasbros* and *Tysnera* decide to do their meditations there while the rest of the party rests at the *Stonehill Inn*.

*Tysnera* and *Tasbros* encounter the returning *Sister Garaele*, injured and the worse for wear. *Sister Garaele* is looking for *Bojangle's Spellbook*,
and the last entity that might know it's location is *Agatha the Banshee*, who haunts the ruins of *Conyberry*. She offers three potions of healing plus
her services upon their return, and says that if *Agatha* is approached correctly and given a gift, she may be amenable to answering questions. *Sister Garaele* offers a silver comb as a gift for *Agatha*.

After conferring and restocking provisions, the group sets off on the *Triboar Trail*, intending to speak to *Agatha* and clear out the Orcs.

Making camp, they are beset by 8 vicious Allosaurs!
