### Summerday +420 hours

#### From the journal of Dame Orky

We ride back in the crawler with a hundred dwarves. They thank us and want to throw a big feast in our honor. There’s an award ceremony where they make Benjamin a Scout and is given a quiver with magic arrows. CoralKing is made a Mystic. Calmul is made an honorary Smith. Geral is awarded the title of Thane. I am named a Champion. Steve is made a Spy. Tysnera and Tasbros are made War Mages. Viker is made a Guardian. Wulrif and Actius are made Mystics. We are all given a +1 Cloak of Protection with the Rockseeker Clan symbols.

We are headed to Phandalin to deliver Iarno Glassstaff to Sildar and deal with the demi-beholder again. As we walk along the path, 2 dinosaurs jump out as us and they look hungry. Benjamin speaks with the dinosaurs. He convinced them to go eat the brontosaurus instead. We finally make it to Phandalin.

We head to the Townmaster’s Hall first to deliver Iarno. Sildar throws him in jail. He reminds us that we are in midsummer and used to have a ward stone to protect them from the undead during the winter. However, it has been befelled? And doesn’t work. Usually a whole church blesses a ward stone, so not an easy thing to obtain. They are usually 200+ lbs so we would need a wagon to haul it. Alternatively, there’s another haunted mine fortress 15 miles south of here called axholm that we can take instead. Savrah’s Cathedral is where we can go to recover an unused ward stone.

Sildar also reminds us that there are a ton of dragons that have been flying around lately. A dragon-laying sword can be found nearby where a famous hero slayed a dragon.

We decide to head to Tresendar Manor to recover the magic armor in the basement, then get the dragon-slaying sword. We walk into the basement and see the spectator.

Turn 1

1. Benjamin investigates to learn the creature’s weaknesses. He returns to report that it has no weaknesses and it floats 20 ft above the ground. So, outside of melee range. It cannot be knocked prone.
2. Steve hides
3. Calmul enhances Orky’s weapon. It deals an extra 1d4 poison damage for an extra minute. He casts heroism on Orky too which gives her temporary hp every round.
4. CoralKing moves behind the creature and holds his action but uses patient defense.
5. The creature psychically attacks CoralKing but he resists it. Orky gets paralyzed. Geral survives the attack as well. Tasbros takes 16 hp of damage.
6. Geral orders Steve to shoot his bow. For his second attack, Geral hits?
7. Wulrif hexes it and it rebounds, hexing Wulrif. His 2 eldritch blasts miss, rebound, and miss Wulrif.
8. Viker goes up to it and uses her boots of spring to jump up and hit it with her mace, then teleports before she lands. She does 4 HP damage.
9. Tysnera throws a dagger at it and does 4 HP damage.
10. Tasbros moves back a little, uses his crossbow to shoot it ,and misses.
11. Actius creates a magical crossbow and shoots it, killing it.

The spectator dissipates and a tiny one appears, attracted to his magic. Wulrif grabs it and puts it in his bag and begins feeding it. Orky makes a max saving throw and recovers her movement.

Tasbros uses move earth to dig, and we see a life-size statue. He detects magic and sees the sword hilt is magic and the tomb. He uses mage hand to lift the sword and it can’t do anything. Orky and Geral climb up to the statue and she feels a question in her mind, is she trustworthy? She said yes and the sword drops and she grabs it. It’s like a lightsaber. It’s called a sun blade and she humbly passes it to Actius to use. Tasbros uses knock to open the tomb. He sees a body covered in dwarven-made armor. Orky takes it.

We then head to the Cathedral. Geral stops by the Townmaster first and wants to know where the gnome mercenaries came from. They came from Gnomenguard and get paid 60 gp each in summer and 120 gp in winter. Gnomenguard is 15 miles southeast of Phandalin. Benjamin has animal handling so he can use a mule to haul a cart. We do all of that and move along. We see a dragon in the distance but make it to the Cathedral without trouble. Steve goes ahead and scouts the premises, detecting 2 dozen Orks and 2 dozen ogres in the courtyard and guard towers. 4 Orks are in each guard tower (adding 16 to the total) and ogres are in the courtyard. He has no idea how many more are inside the actual building.

CoralKing approaches the Cathedral using Wulrif’s megaphone saying he wants the ward stone. An ogre approaches asking him to repeat it. CoralKing said he wants the ward stone or else. It says “what’s a warthumb?” CoralKing said “give us the ward stone or else”. He said “what do you mean ‘or else’ I will crush you.” A smaller ork approaches and inquires the same. CoralKing repeats that we want the ward stone and they respond that they have no idea what we are talking about. They said they have heard of our group and they outnumber us. He tells them about Axholm where they can relocate. They said they just encountered a dragon and arrived here shortly before, they are not moving. CoralKing asks them if we can come in and take a look to identify it.

Viker steps up and suggests she transfigure into a fly and flies in to find the stone. She sees 4 Ork spellcasters at the altar chanting around this big glowing rock. This dark figure, avoiding the light, starts to approach Viker. So, she books it back out. One of the Ork spellcasters turns around and shoots her with 4 magic missiles. They do 8 HP damage. Viker makes it back out.

Once CoralKing hears about this, he snaps his fingers and we immediately head in to destroy the group.
