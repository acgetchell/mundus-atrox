#### From the journal of Countess Orky

So, we need to get the bodies to the site of the murder. Luckily, this is on the same level. So, we can drag them. Then, we can have *Tasbros* transport me and the Unholy Avenger back and forth to the site. So, we begin by each grabbing a body.

*Wulrif* touches *Brother Basil* and tries to Thrall him, but is pyschically bounced by some sort of powerful an entity that seems to be cohabitating. We try to find a way to make use of *Brother Basil* the best way possible. So, we ask *Tasbros* to ask someone from the **Magisterium** if they will pick him up and bring him back to the **Magisterium** to hold him in the Anti-Magic field. A specialist wizard agrees. He will come with *Tasbros* to pick him up and *Tasbros* can take the Unholy Avenger too. The wizard seems interested in coming to see what we are up to. We tell him he can return, but he needs to secure *Brother Basil* first.

*Viker* casts Stunning Symbol in the center of the circle of bodies. The trigger is when *Lord Varkosian* steps foot on the glyph. *Tasbros* arrives…

Round 1

1. *CoralKing* readies his action for when *Lord Varkosian* arrives.
2. The wizard puts the magic manacles on *Brother Basil*, and Teleports away.
3. *Tasbros* readies his action.
4. *Lord Varkosian* arrives and Wraiths rise from all 12 of bodies. As he lands on the Symbol, a bright sphere appears. *Tasbros* is affected by the Stunning Symbol and everyone else was spared. He managed to squeak out a save and ended up fine.
5. *CoralKing* attacks *Lord Varkosian* twice with his Staff of Striking and a Flurry of Blows and does 49 HP damage.
6. *Benjamin* shot at the Death Knight and did 22 HP damage.
7. *Tasbros* casts Sunbeam on the Death Knight and a Wraith, doing 32 HP damage.
8. *Lord Varkosian* casts Hellfire Orb and hits *CoralKing*, *Tasbros*, and me for 33 HP damage. However, *CoralKing* was able to dodge it!
9. The Wraiths begin to attack all of us. *Tasbros* gets 28 HP damage. *CoralKing* is hit for 18 HP damage. *Benjamin* is hit for 14 HP damage. *Viker* takes 18 HP damage.
10. *Viker* uses Misty Step to attack the Death Knight with Sunbeam, doing 25 HP damage.
11. *Wulrif* casts Witch Bolt on the Wraiths in front of him, doing 57 HP damage.
12. I cast Spirit Shroud and hit him twice for 41 HP damage.

Round 2

1. *Benjamin* uses Hunter's Sense on the Wraiths and learns they are resistant to Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Thunder; Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing from non-magical Attacks that aren't Silvered. They are immune to necrotic damage and poison.
2. *CoralKing* attacks the Death Knight with his Staff of Striking and does a Flurry of Blows. He deals 44 HP damage.
3. *Lord Varkosian* attacks me three times, for 110 HP damage.
4. The Wraiths attack *Tasbros* for 44 HP damage. *CoralKing* is attacked, uses his Protective Wings, and gets 20 HP damage. *Benjamin* is getting hit for 26 HP damage, also reducing his max HP.
5. *Viker* casts Mass Cure Wounds for 41 HP on the party and uses her Unicorn Spirit on *Benjamin* for 15 HP.
6. *Wulrif* casts Scatter on the party and pulls us out of the action.
7. I cast Spirit Shroud and hit *Lord Varkosian* twice for 53 HP damage.

Round 3

1. *Benjamin* heals himself.
2. *CoralKing* speaks to the Wraiths nearest him and they don’t respond positively.
3. *Lord Varkosian* is still down.
4. The Wraiths swarm the group and attack. Lady Varkosian screams “STOP! Don’t you recognize me?!?” and they stop to look at her. “You, *Gareth*, we had you over for dinner.” She continues to call out to each of the spirits and they stand there confused.
5. *Tasbros* stands up and uses Persuasion on *Gareth*, to try and get him to persuade *Lord Varkosian* to repent. *Gareth* responds that we are the **Illuminati** they are seeking to destroy.
6. *Viker* casts Mass Cure Wounds so 20 HP for *Benjamin* and 15 for everyone on he totem. So, everyone gets 35 HP.
7. *Wulrif* follows *Tasbros* and appeals to the Wraiths.
8. I attempt to get *Lord Varkosian* to repent. He responds that it’s true he killed them all. I tell him his wife is here, she is back and she loves him. He responds that he slew his men and he had to. *Wulrif* questions him and asks why he did it, he said he was commanded to by the one who holds the book. *Wulrif* uses Detect Thoughts and he sees *Brother Basil* with tentacles coming out of his sleeves while he is holding the book we found earlier. *Wulrif* holds up the book and asks him to repent. Lord responds that we need to destroy the book. Then, he is absorbed back into the sword and it glows bright white. The bodies of the Wraiths suddenly drop.

I grab the Holy Avenger and hear *Lord Varkosian*’s voice in my head “You must wield me to set this right.” He said he will do his penance in this sword until I destroy all sources of evil that led to his downfall. He and *Lady Varkosian* speak about their past and how they got to where they are now. He said because he is a sword, he is passing his estate onto her. She brings up the fact that he has an illegitimate child. He said it wasn’t his fault, the child’s mother is very manipulative.

I arrange for a proper **Templar** burial. A portal appears and the cathedral is visible on the other side. *Wulrif* uses Telekinesis to move the bodies through.

I inquire about *Brother Basil* and the **Magisterium** Initiates come yelling that there is a massive battle occurring ...
