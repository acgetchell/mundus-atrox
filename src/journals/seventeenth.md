### Summerday +588 hours

Except for *Benjamin*, they never saw it coming.

One moment they were trudging along single file in the weird luminous gloom of the Underdark, then darkness cut off that vision.

*Benjamin* started, avoided 3 darts before taking 5 more. *Orky* felt the pricks of bolts and heard her companions slumping into unconsciousness around her.

*Orky* unclenches her gauntlet, slowly releasing her sword.

The Drow Priestess locks eyes with her.

> "Surrender, or your friends will die."

She could Channel her wrath and smite this woman back into whatever foul pit she crawled from.

The Drow Elite Guard shuffle, though all weapons remain pointed unerringly at her.

> "Last chance -- then they become fodder for spiders."

*Orky* looks at the half-Drow half-Spider thing. It scuttles backwards.

Finally, she nods.

They take her weapons and place magic shackles on her, but know better than to push it further. The huge spider-centaurs
come forward and Orky watches, subdued, as her companions are webbed to their broad backs.

> "I think we lost them," says *Tysnera*, breathlessly.
>
> "We should keep going," replies *CoralKing* with no trace of exertion in his voice.
>
> "Yeah, that kinda might be a good idea," says *Steve*, huffing. "Just let me catch my breath and we can keep going."
>
> "Is there any particular reason, other than not wanting to be tortured or sacrificed?" asks *Geral*.
>
> "Well, y'know, the Drow High Priestess? She might be kinda a little upset," says *Steve*.
>
> "She seemed pretty upset before," replies *Geral*.
>
> "Yeah, well, I took back our stuff, what belonged to us, y' know? But I *stole* her Hand Crossbow and Tentacle Rod," says *Steve* proudly.
