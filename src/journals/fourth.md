In the aftermath of the battle with the pack of Allosaurs, the party camped between the tread marks of a passing *Urb* on the *Triboar Trail*, reasoning the deep indentations
and broken ground would provide a more defensible camp site. While resting they saw a curious sight: strange, whirring clockwork automatons marching single file out of the
forest over to the bodies of the Allosaurs. Ignoring the party entirely, the strange machines proceeded to render the bodies into small pieces.

The sights and sounds were unpleasant to say the least, so the party moved a bit further along the trail of the Urb. The rest period was otherwise uneventful, the light
from the *Enclouding* giving a dreamlike quality while everyone meditated and healed.

Midway through next period’s march the *Urban* trail turned North into the forest, a vast scar of sawn-down trees and torn-up earth rent between the giant Sequoias.

The group continued East, reaching the ruins of Conyberry.

> The forest grows dark and still as the trail winds deeper into the trees. Heavy vines and thick layers of moss drape the branches,
> and the air is noticeably colder than it was in the ruined village. Rounding a bend in the trail, you see a screen made from the warped
> branches of trees standing close together, woven into a domelike shelter in the shadows. A low doorway leads inside.

The adventurers enter.

> The air grows cold, and a powerful feeling of dread grips you. A cold, pale light flickers in the air, rapidly taking on the form of a
> female elf, her hair and robes waving in a spectral wind. She might have been beautiful once, but a hateful expression twists her features now.
> “Foolish mortals,” she snarls. “What do you want here? Do you not know it is death to seek me out?”

"We have brought you a gift," replies *Wulrif*. He offers her *Garaele's* *Silver Comb*.

> The ghostly figure smiles with cold amusement. “Very well,” she says. “I know that you seek many things. Ask me one question, and I will give you an answer.”

"Where is Bojangle's spellbook?" asks *Wulrif*.

> "I traded that to a necromancer named Tsernoth from the city of Iriaebor, let's see, more than a hundred years ago. I do not know what happened to it after that."

Agatha disappears.

After some consultation, the party decides to head *South* to look at the *Old Owl Well*, a point of interest on the map. The ground gets steeper and the wind picks up.

They encounter an old dwarf riding a horseless carriage.

"Hallooooo!" he yells, seemingly friendly.

"Hello", replies *Orky*.

After establishing that he was relatively friendly, the party asks a few questions.

On the strange clockwork scavengers.

"Oh, avoid the *Clockwork Horrors* if you can."

"But what do they want?"

"No one knows, but best not to get in their way."

"What's Old Owl Well?"

"Oh, an ancient tower. Be careful, there's been *Undead* spotted around there."

After a few more shouts the party continues on.

The party makes camp on the hillside as the wind picks up.

And that's when the Orc war-band attacks!
