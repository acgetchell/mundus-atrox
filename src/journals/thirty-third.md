### Summerday +1388 hours

#### From the journal of Countess Orky

*CoralKing* doesn’t want to get squished by the Dragon. We decide to investigate the chaos surrounding *Brother Basil*’s disappearance. *Tasbros* lets us into the **Magisterium**. Everyone is shocked about *Doctorate Julian Yewshade's* death, who was well-known and adored. We find the bodies left by the black spheres are strange because there is no signature; they don’t seem to match any clade lines of Illithids that are known. The Chancellor and Provost are busy, so we head to the Department of Necromancy. A Gnome greets us creepily. He tells us the *Chair Maeve Shadowdusk* is busy and wants to take a message. He directs us to the classroom where *Professor Shadowdusk* is teaching and we follow. We listen to the lecture about *Autumnset* and **The Shadowfell**. We speak after she finishes and she expresses how confused she is by the whole *Brother Basil* situation. She is very concerned about the Illithids ability to cast darkness that is impervious to the **Arclight**. She said **The Shadowfell** wouldn’t be powerful enough to do so, only something from the **Far Realm** would be capable of that. We decide to leave and regroup.

I ask *Lord Varkosian* about the situation and he says *Brother Basil* wasn’t the beginning of his downfall, but he definitely contributed to it. He asks if we ever found *Basil’s* mother. I suddenly remember her and how we never tracked her down. Then, I realize we never asked *Lord Varkosian* why he became a Death Knight in the first place. He said he felt it was the right thing to do at the time. He said the **Illuminati** wanted him to summon *Baphomet* to control or consume all beings that were raised from the dead. He said there were more steps in the ritual. They needed an artifact, a gigantic sacrifice, and *Baphomet*.

We decide to track down *Basil's* mother in the mines. *Benjamin* tracks her and we find there was an industrial accident and a lot of people died. However, she went missing outside of **Neverwinter** about 10 cycles ago. It seems that she staged this incident as a breakout. Her tracks change as she moves. That indicates to *Benjamin* that she is a shapeshifter. She seems to have a set of Drow and a set of Human footprints. We found out that she stole a vehicle when she escaped.

We go back to my [Manor], open **The Book** and attempt to read the writings between *Brother Basil* and his mother. We find out she is a Drow noble and was instructed to bear a child that may have been to create a receptacle for a possession by *Llolth*. Her last message to *Brother Basil* is that she is leaving to reclaim her House and Throne. I ask where **Menzoberranzan** is and *CoralKing* recalls there was a war fought a generation ago between **Menzoberranzan** and **Blingdenstone**. So, the Deep Gnomes might know.

Our new goal is to recapture *Brother Basil*. We recall *Grazillaxx* the Illithid from the Society of Brilliance and how it may know what's happening in the **Underdark**. We decide we need to plan and prepare to head back into the **Underdark**. So, prepare spells, prepare teleportation circles, protection, friends, etc. I ask *Lord Varkosian* if he knows if *Brother Basil*’s mother was Drow. He said he knew she was elven, but not Drow. She said she was a refugee from her people and he had no reason to doubt her.

I receive an official summons from *Lord Commander Sozenskaat*. I attend to his office and he passes a letter to me. It reads:

> Come at once to **Gauntlgrym** for an audience with *King Bruenor Battlehammer*, to discuss matters of grave importance concerning your experiences in the **Underdark**.

Incidentally, *King Bruenor* is holding a convention and wants a representative of the **Templar**. By attending I can accomplish both at once. *Lord Commander Sozenskaat* has procured an airship for our party since ****Gauntlgrym**** is in the mountains. As it’s getting close to *Winternight* (when it's too dangerous to fly), we should return by Teleportation.

*Tasbros* and Tysnera are also summoned by the Provost of the **Magisterium**. They were asked for by name by *King Bruenor* to attend a convention in **Gauntlgrym** within 7 cycles.

Meanwhile, *Wulrif* is researching guides to the **Far Realm** to track down the author of **The Book**. He comes upon the Demilich *Acerak*, an Archlich who travels between worlds and is known to take sick pleasure in devouring the souls of adventurers, whom he lures into trap-ridden dungeons where they suffer horrible deaths. One such dungeon is at the Spine of the World, called the Tomb of the Nine because *Acerak* slew 9 false gods and sealed their souls within it.

We return to the [Manor] and suddenly a smell perfuses the room ...

Through the construction of the ballroom, we see 6 globes of darkness. Suddenly 6 giant Duergar appear alongside the globes of darkness.
