### Summerday +1108 hours

#### From the journal of Dame Orky

We approach the next room and we feel our magic items lose their magic; our amour feels heavier. We move slightly closer and Geral sees a beholder floating about 40 feet off the ground. He can also see some constructs skittering around in the back of the room. He sees flesh golems protecting the beholder. He said “it’s a shame you broke my toys, did you bring me new ones?” Geral asks where Droki is and he said he took a shrinking potion and moved through the rat hole in the wall. He said we wouldn’t be able to get through the hole without a potion too. He wants something for his trouble of making us a potion. He wants a drop of blood each. He said Droki went to the obelisk at the center of the maze. There is no other way he knows of other than through this hole.

Wulrif offers to add his name to his book that will revive the beholder if he were to ever die. The beholder is very interested and asks to see the book. Now Wulrif feels there is an extra attachment to his book. We take a short rest while the beholder makes the potion. The constructs come by to take a drop of our blood. Finally, the beholder tells us to drink the potion and enter the rat hole. He tells us one last thing that we need a dimensional pocket to put our extra mass. No one knows if we have one. Calmul eventually realizes that he has the ability to build one! He disappears into a fog and we can see him grasping at nearby objects and we see this object manifest. It’s a metal, folding contraption thing that expands and contracts and has lots of gears on it.

We drink the potion and we shrink, watching our masses sink away into this metal box. We are now 6” high and decide that someone needs to start tracking Droki. Benjamin and Wulrif work together to track Droki. After 8 hours we make some progress down these tunnels. Benjamin loses the trail and takes a guess as to which way we should travel. Geral gives Benjamin some inspiration and he eventually finds his way. We start to feel tingly after a long time of traveling. Then, we find ourselves in a larger area and start to see rocks orbit us. We realize that we are growing in size. We quickly get Calmul to open the bag of holding so we can gain our original forms.

We hear a voice say “See M’lady, here they are.” We are immediately faced with the blaring noise of an alarm, alerting every creature in this cavern of our presence.

Turn 1
Benjamin casts a spell to damage 4 creatures by 1 HP and the alarm, killing it.
CoralKing teleports to the top of the highest mountain and swings at the nearest drow with his staff, doing 27 HP damage.

Benjamin shoots a bolt at the Drider and kills it!

I pull out my dark religious symbol gifted to me from the Dragon, the monolith heals, and we find ourselves in a maze. We hear a loud clanking, see a smelt, and a guy standing there with dead humans around him. We see a creature saying he “sacrificed his companions to summon ___, who are you?!?” We are standing near a giant creature that looks like a giant goat on its hind legs, with 3 sets of horns, and a pig face (*Baphomet*).

Wulrif attempts telekinesis to lift up the screaming guy, but fails. I recognize the guy as a Death Knight, who is required to state his sins to become a Death Knight. He screams out that he slew all of his fellow templars over and over. We realize somehow that we are back on the surface, in Neverwinter.

Turn 1
Steve readies his action

Avren does 17 HP damage.
CoralKing shadow steps to the Death Knight and uses 2 staff strikes, doing 23 HP damage. He tries a stunning strike, but it fails strangely.

CoralKing uses flurry of blows for 8 HP damage.
Benjamin does 24 HP damage.
The Death Knight is still confused, luckily!
Tysnera kills it!

We search the bodies and take the sword, an unholy avenger. We give that to Wulrif. The crusaders come down to see the mess and have a magic photograph of our battle. They bring us upstairs to the lord commander and ask us how we got there. We explain what happened with the monolith. We are not imprisoned and are told some people were there to vouch for us. We see an airship and some dwarves. We make claims? And some reporters come by to hear us? Then, Geral becomes a baron? The dwarves ask us if there is anything we want. We feel that it’s likely that if the Dragon egg is returned, it would be destroyed.  

The Death Knight is going to keep reappearing and summoning *Baphomet* unless we destroy the unholy avenger. We can suppress its magic in an Antimagic Field until we can cleanse it. An ancient red Dragon’s breath can destroy it, curiously.

Calmul is given a 7-barrel musket.
