14. The 2 remaining Ogres turn to run into the cathedral. *CoralKing* hits one for 6 HP on their way. As the last one disappeared, the spears attacking *Wulrif* disappeared too.

We spend the shadowspawn into the cathedral and it dissipates. *Actias* uses arcana to see if he can discern anything about the darkness. He doesn’t do well and sees that its magical darkness. The darkness seems to bulge out of the cathedral and a voice says “congrats, you got rid of some of my servants.” We say we are only there for the rock. He said “well, we have uses for that rock. However, there are other magic things you can earn.” This cathedral doesn’t seem to be consecrated and that’s the opposite of how a cathedral should be. It’s not keeping Undead away and etc.

I use divine sense and I can sense that there were 4 Fiends, and now there are 5. Clearly the ward stone has been reversed and is useless to us in its current state. So, we ask about the swords and the voice tells us 1 is a rod and is in an ancient dwarven fortress overrun by Undead. Another sword is in a burial mound. A woodland staff in the shape of a tree is in the depths of the forest. A pair of gloves is in the bowels of **[Neverwinter]**.

We see a little girl with black hair and she asks us “so, are you going to take the offer from the demon?” We say no, she tells us the weapons are probably cursed.  She tells us her people are trapped in there with her. Her name is *Chiyo* and said her people were misled by promises and told lies. She tells us they are summoning more creatures every cycle, there are 5 in there currently. There are shadow demons, Glabrezu which is the main one talking to us. 2 beasts (Hezrous), 2 Chasmes, and 4 Shadow Demons, and 4 corrupted shamans. She said if we go in to attack them, her people will attack them from behind. Her mate is the leader, the one we talked to first. He is being coerced by the shamans. She estimates we are outnumbered. We learn that Glabrezu emits darkness at will. *Wulrif* attempts to read her mind and fails. She shows us her true form, as an Oni, which are lawful. The ward stone is under the altar, using an active gate to call their own kind, Fiends.

*Actias* is lighting up his sun blade, we take formation and move into the courtyard. We don’t see anything yet.

Round 1

1. *Steve* hides and holds his action
2. *CoralKing* holds his action
3. This giant, deafeningly loud, bug flies toward us and *Actias* and *Wulrif* both fall unconscious. The proboscis enters *Actias* and he drops the sun blade. He loses 30 HP and decreases his maximum HP by 30. It’s draining his blood. They are both unconscious for 10 minutes.

The Oni yells “wait!” and seems to heal herself. The Ork seems to imply the shamans are his friends and instructs the other Orcs to halt and not attack.

We ask for the stone and she agrees. *Geral* invites her to stay with us in our town through the winter and he said he will hire her and her people to protect the forge. The Oni instructs us to stay in the light so we don’t have to face the 4 shadow demons lurking in the dark. 3 shamans, 1 Ork chief, 16 Ogres (4 chain brutes), and 23 Orcs remain to work in the forge.
