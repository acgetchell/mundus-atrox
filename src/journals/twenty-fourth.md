### Summerday +1084 hours

#### From the journal of Dame Orky

The city appears very smoky and black. Some of our group wakes up coughing and have a level of Exhaustion. Each day, we must avoid **Grackle lung**. I heal my team as they succumb.

The group heads to the armory for some armor. We stock up and head to **The Whorlstone Tunnels**. We have 4 visible giant-sized Stone Guard to escort us.

We approach the tunnels and see a fissure in the granite below the docks. It’s about 5 feet wide, but very tall. We enter the tunnel and the ceiling seems to be climbing as we continue. The tunnel is very wet and dimly-lit -- it is **Faerzress-Suffused**, and dampens any Divination spells or Teleportation abilities as well as adds Wild Magic surges.

We hear chittering outside of our vision range. I see a carpet of writhing insects that are shying away from *Actias*’s Sunblade. As they move away, we see bones that are completely stripped of flesh. There is some white fur left on some bones that *Viker* recognizes as matching the hide of the satchel she just bought. One of our familiars notices a trickle of water coming down the wall. The cavern widens out and we see a ramp that continues forward and a second that leads up a level. It appears that we have entered something’s dwelling. *Wulrif* sends his familiar up to investigate with *Steve* and they see a mouth that appears in the stone wall, asking what we are doing in its owner’s workshop. *Steve* freezes in amazement that he was seen. We respond that we are looking for a Derro by the name of *Droki*. *Geral* asks who its master is. It responds that its master is busy right now.

*Geral* walks up, takes one of his rations, and tries to feed the mouth. He is unsuccessful. Then, a giant wave-like creature appears with Plate Mail over his shoulders and a weapon in its hands. *Geral* responds that we are looking for the master. It remains stoic and blocks our way. *Benjamin* wants to use Hunter’s Sense on this thing, so he moves forward and analyzes it. *Wulrif* follows to protect him. *Benjamin* tells us that it is a Water Elemental Myrmidon, resistant to acid, piercing, slashing, immune to poison, petrification, or being knocked prone. It has no weaknesses.

*Geral* notices via Blindsight that he is being surprise attacked by something invisible, but is of course, immune due to Sentinel. He alerts us. Invisible Derro appear behind *CoralKing*, *Wulrif*, and *Actias*. All of whom are surprised. *Wulrif* is attacked 3 times and takes 27 HP bludgeoning and 8 HP psychic damage (he backlashes the other 8HP of psychic damage). *Actias* takes 43 HP damage. *Geral* gets hit for 36 HP damage. He hits back three times and misses.
