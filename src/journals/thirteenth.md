#### From the journal of Dame Orky

Benjamin thinks the oozes came from the Underdark, but we can't find any large passages.

We decide to contract some dwarves to plug up any underdark holes we find. We collect our treasure from the wraith to hire a militia. We got 150 gp per person. 1 gp per day is a ton of money for a solider is a lot of money. Geral is considering paying them 1 sp per day.

Gundren pulls Geral aside and shows him an elven airship (~150 ft long) that has landed and the crew is approaching us. They seem friendly. Tasbros talks to them and they said they notice we activated the spell forge and he wants to trade so they can access items of power. Geral asks Gundren who built the forge. He said he thinks 3,000 years. The elves and dwarves had an agreement previously to use it. Geral asks the elf how he knew we cleared it. He said it sang to them as soon as it was cleared. He said his name was Barvation Starwright and the elendile is his community. Geral introduces himself and shows interest in creating a trade agreement. He is offering 5% of the value of the items they make. Geral mentions the drow we captured to Barvation. Barvation offers to take it to the high courts for judgement. Some soldier walks over to the drow and puts some sort of magical item on the drow, as if magically binding him. Geral talks to Gundren about what happened with the wraith. He agreed that we should find some way to let him pass on. Gundren seems suspicious that this creature is a wraith, he thinks it could be a ghost.

Gundren mentions someone’s family is under attack by giants. I think Barvation is the one speaking. He said he would give us 15% if we save his family. We wholeheartedly agree and jump on the airship to find this community. We ascend very quickly and set off!

We see a very large sandcrawler vehicle that is being pounded on by very large creatures. We are all handed a feather by Barvation and told not to lose it and just jump off the edge of the ship. We count 11 giants and 12 ogres with various equipment on them. 10 giants are massive but 1 is super jacked, he is a firegiant. Ogres are on the front trying to jam the door open. Geral decides we should land in front of the door and protect that first. The magic folk should land on top of the sandcrawler.

The vehicle cannot move because there are a ton of clubs stuck in it. We need some large people to help pull some stuff. We use Charm on the firegiant that is still alive to try and get him to pull the vehicle. We surround the firegiant, weapons raised, and Wulrif commands the firegiant to fix the vehicle. He complies and starts walking away, puts a chain on the ground, steps through the chain, and disappears. The dwarves are very happy and we inspect the vehicle. It has these weird things that makes food. We take a long rest now.
