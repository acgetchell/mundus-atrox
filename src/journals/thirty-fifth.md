7. *Actias* manages to climb up the hill on his own.

We smell burning Troll and *Benjamin* tracks the Trolls back to a cave they were covering up. There's a strong blizzard swirling around us, so we walk up their driveway. In this cave, we see a bunch of stuff strewn about. We find copper, silver, gold, and platinum coins:

- Copper - 900
- Silver - 600
- Gold - 1500
- Platinum - 70

We also find a magical bag containing a spell scroll and a potion. *Tasbros* uses Mage Hand to grab the bag and gives it to *Actias*. *Tysnera* discovers a Potion of Fire Breath and a spell scroll of Sleet Storm. We spend 3 cycles in this cave as the storm passes. Eventually, after six more cycles of trekking to the **Surbrin Hills**, *Daavra* leads us to a cave that is the entrance to the **Underdark**.

We follow *Daavra* through the **Underdark** and our first cycle back underground uneventful. Then, on the 2nd cycle we enter a large cavern with a crevice about 20 feet wide. *Actias* casts Arcane Gate to let us across safely. Next cycle, we see a new clearing with glowing fungi and a foul smell. We are able to gather that this is also a large cavern. *Benjamin* investigates and finds 10 creatures shaped like centipedes with tentacles. There was a big battle and these creatures are eating the remnants. *Viker* casts Pass Without Trace, we gather around her, and slowly make our way around and past these creatures. Later, we make camp and rest. A gang of Hobgoblins ambush us. *Benjamin* screams "Wake Up!" and we all jump up and prepare for battle.

Round 1

1. *Tysnera* holds her action.
2. *CoralKing* walks over to the Hobgoblins and he can see 3 bands of Hobgoblins ready to attack.
3. *Actias* moves out of his tent, Misty Steps to one band of Hobgoblins, and casts Blur.
4. Another one of the bands of Hobgoblins surrounds *CoralKing* and he gets hit twice for 26 HP damage. *Actias* gets hit for 52 HP too.
5. I Misty Step 30 feet, walk to the leader of the Hobgoblins, and hit him twice for 18 HP damage.
6. *Tasbros* summons a Draconic Spirit (Chromatic) and it attacks the 2 Hobgoblins next to his tent. The dragon attacks them for 17 HP, dropping one. *Tasbros* takes 3 HP damage and the other Hobgoblin takes 7 HP damage.
7. *Viker* casts Call Lightning and does 27 HP damage on 3 Hobgoblins, killing them.

Round 2

1. *Benjamin* Stone Skins me.
2. *Tysnera* casts Maximized Fireball and slaughters all of the Hobgoblins in the radius. The large one takes 60 HP damage to the face.
3. The large one speaks Common to me and says “Parlay.”

He said he will help us travel around the creatures in this area through the next bend if we don’t kill him. I ask *Daavra* what she thinks and she says he can probably help us, and we can dispose of him if we need to. I agree and we take a rest.
