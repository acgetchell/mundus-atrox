### Summerday +852 hours

#### From the journal of Dame Orky

*Wulrif* dies when he reverts back to his normal form. I use Lay On Hands to give him 50 HP and bring him back to consciousness. Then, we all take a long rest.

We discovered an island with mushrooms on it. It seems steep, maybe the top of a stalagmite. We all take a long rest. I look around to see if we’re safe. I notice some strange but small things rustling around in the mushrooms. The mushrooms are around 60 ft high.

We begin to hear music and singing in a hauntingly beautiful soprano. We see an inverted mushroom cap and a Half-Elven woman holding a lute and playing. *Geral* approaches her.

> "Hello, do we know you?"
>
> "No, I don't think so."
>
> "Do you know where we are?”
>
> "In Dark Lake, eastern shore, probably near **Sloobludop**, though the currents make it hard to tell”.
>
> "What is all that rustling?"
>
> "Could be bats, Stirges, hopefully not Ixitxachitl."
>
> "Can you guide us out of here?"
>
> "Sure."
>
> "I am *Geral* and this is *Orky*."
>
> "I am *Avren*, a Bard by avocation. I collect lore and knowledge from the Underdark. You look lost."
>
> "We are indeed, and seeking a way out of here. How did you get here?"
>
> "A waterfall deep in the Neverwinter Wood."
>
> "Oh," says *Geral*, disappointed. "I suppose you don't go back the same way."
>
> "No," Avren replies with a tinkling laugh. "I normally meet someone friendly, trade with them, and take one of the trails out, usually through **Gracklstugh**. That's about 8-10 days from here, as the raft wanders."
>
> "Who lives in **Gracklstugh**?"
>
> "Deep Gnomes, Duergar, and Dwarves. Stay away from *Themberchaud* and those who serve him."
>
> "*Themberchaud*?"
>
> "The Wyrmsmith of **Gracklstugh**. An ancient Red Dragon of unlimited appetite, though those serving him know how to satiate him," *Avren* says darkly.
>
> "How do you find your way?"
>
> "Oh, sometimes you can be friendly with the Kuo-Toa, as long as you don't look like an easy victim. They are a bit mad, but they can be friendly, and they enjoy my music. They are the ones who live in **Sloobludop**, and worship the Sea Mother."

*Avren* is full of useful information about the mushrooms around us and telling us which ones make water, wine, food, and other things.

We remember that we are here to hunt Fiends for the Society of Brilliance and find out why they are here. We decide to take a day and fashion some more secure rafts. That day goes well! The team makes food and water from the mushrooms. Avren points out some mushrooms with orange and red stripes and says they are called “The Devil’s Mushrooms”, making a really strong red liquor that the deep gnomes like. That can be made in a still. *Calmul* busts out a still in a cloud of small, whirring, magical devices. No one is brave enough to drink it. We end up with 2 wine skins of the stuff, which *Avren* says will be worth a lot in **Gracklstugh**.

*Benjamin* decides to explore and finds 3 octopodes in the tops of the tree-like mushrooms *Avren* calls Zurkhwood. One of them floats off ... in fear? Another is chewing on a Stirge. I like that one. *Steve* attempts to catch it and but somehow it detects ultra-sneaky *Steve* and escapes. Now, all 3 are gone.

These are the occupants of the rafts:

Canoe 1 (2 people) - *Steve* and *Benjamin*

Canoe 2 (2 people) - *Tysnera* and *Viker*

Raft (10 people) - Me right in the middle, *Calmul* + apprentice, *CoralKing*, *Tasbros*, *Geral*, *Actias*, and *Wulrif*.

*Avren’s* Mushroom (1 person) - *Avren*

*Viker* decides to morph into a Shark to tow the rafts. She takes off at 35 MPH and *Tysnera* falls out of the raft. *Geral* cuts the rope off of *Viker*, while *Wulrif* telepathically tells *Viker* that we lost *Tysnera*. After 10 minutes, *Tysnera* is back in her raft. We communicate again and work out a way to tell *Viker* if things go wrong. She takes off again.

Sometime later, *Viker* smells prey, tainted with Fiendish overtones. Suddenly, large and small fishy-scaly things swarm our rafts!

> "Kuo-toa, not the friendly kind!" *Avren* shouts.
>
> "What are the big uglies?" *Geral* asks.
>
> "Merrow! Servants of the *Dark Father*!" *Avren* replies.

Turn 1

1. *Benjamin* decides to find out the weaknesses of the Merrow. They are Monstrosities tainted by Fiends, and have no weaknesses. Worse, they are immune to being Charmed or Frightened.

10. All the creatures we seemed to damage, just got healed by another Kuo-Toa Archpriest?!?
11. *Avren* casts Thunder Wave and hits 3 Kuo-Toa, doing 18 damage to them and driving them away.
12. A Kuo-Toa attempts to net *Tysnera*, but *Geral* hamstrings it with an attack of opportunity as it tries to get past him, sticking it in place. Yay!
13. *Tysnera* casts fireball and does 37 HP damage to a Merrow and bunch of Kuo-Toa. Yay!
14. The Kuo-Toa with *Tasbros* stuck in it's polearm pulls him underwater. Boo!

Turn 3

1. *Benjamin* shoots the Merrow in the head and does 22 HP damage.
2. *Tasbros* doesn't escape and is running out of breath.
3. *CoralKing* moves to the back of the raft and attacks one of the Merrow with his Staff of Striking, doing 25 HP damage. He also uses Flurry of Blows for 8 HP more damage.

9. The Archpriests that *Viker* was chewing on and attacking *Avren* decide to skedaddle.
10. *Avren* holds her action.
11. *Tysnera* holds her action.
12. *Tasbros* bursts to the surface, *Viker* eats the Kuo-Toa and comes back to the surface to tow us away quickly before the banished Merrow pop back. This gives us enough time to take a short rest.

We keep going along and we see more Kuo-Toa. They begin to start swimming parallel to us. They start talking in Undercommon, which *CoralKing* and *Avren* understand.

> "Why did your people attack us?" asks *CoralKing*.
>
> "That was not us! Those were blasphemers who follow the *Deep Father*!" says the Kuo-Toa.
>
> "Who are you" asks *CoralKing*.
>
> "I am *Ploopploopeen*, Archpriest of *Blibdoolpoolp*. We are the true followers of the *Sea Mother* and we will reward you if you help us fight these blasphemers. You look like you are trying to get up to the surface. We can help you get there. We know where the headquarters of the *Deep Father* is."
>
> "Ask them why they want our help," says *Viker*.
>
> "We are the defenders of our faith," replies *Ploopploopeen*. "Long have the inhabitants of **Sloobludop** lived in harmonious service to the will of the *Sea Mother*. But recently, my own daughter *Bloppblippodd* experienced a powerful vision of
> *Leemooggoogoon* the *Deep Father*, proclaiming him our new god. Her power has increased greatly, and many of our people have been swayed to her cause. We are split in two, fighting among ourselves. The followers of the *Deep Father* have been
> making an increasing number of offerings on his alter -- killing blood sacrifices and then casting bloody chum into the waters of the Darklake, where it is consumed by ... something."

*CoralKing* gets the sense that they are telling the truth, but he can’t be sure.

> "What do we get for helping you?" asks *CoralKing*.
>
> "We can show you the way to **Gracklstugh** by safe paths."
>
> "What is the plan?"
>
> "We will pretend to offer you to the followers of the *Deep Father* as a sacrifice, to mend our breach. Then, when you are at their altar, we will attack."
>
> "We will not give up our weapons."
>
> "They will not care. They believe the *Deep Father* is irresistable. They will not expect you to fight back."
