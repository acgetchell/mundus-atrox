#### From the journal of Dame Orky

*Wulrif* nearly dies when he reverts back to his normal form. I use Lay On Hands to give him 50 HP and bring him back to consciousness. Then, we all take a long rest.

We discovered an island with mushrooms on it. It seems steep, maybe the top of a stalagmite. I look around to see if we’re safe. I notice some strange but small things rustling around in the mushrooms. The mushrooms are around 60 feet high.

We hear music and singing in a hauntingly beautiful soprano. We see an inverted mushroom cap and a Half-Elven woman holding a lute and playing. *Geral* goes to the shore nearest her craft.

> "Hello, do we know you?"
>
> "No, I don't think so."
>
> "Do you know where we are?”
>
> "**Darklake**, eastern shore, probably near **Sloobludop**, though the currents make it hard to tell”.
>
> "Do you hear that rustling?"
>
> "Could be bats, Stirges -- hopefully not Ixitxachitl."
>
> "What are -- what you just said?"
>
> "Fiendish little bloodsuckers, look like small manta rays with fangs and poison-barbed tails." She shudders.

*Calmul* looks around wildly for something to hide under. Seeing nothing of use, a cloud of clockwork machines begin constructing a tent.

> "Can you guide us out of here?"
>
> "Sure."
>
> "I am *Geral* and this is *Orky*."
>
> "Pleased to make your acquaintance! I am *Avren*, a Bard by avocation." She makes an elaborate, graceful bow without falling out of her craft. "I collect lore and knowledge from the **Underdark**. You look lost."
>
> "We are indeed, and seeking a way out of here. How did you get here?"
>
> "A waterfall deep in the **Neverwinter Wood**."
>
> "Oh," says *Geral*, disappointed. "I suppose you don't go back the same way."
>
> "No," *Avren* replies with a tinkling laugh. "I normally meet someone friendly, trade with them, and take one of the trails out, usually through **Gracklstugh**. That's about 8-10 cycles from here, as the raft wanders."
>
> "Who lives in **Gracklstugh**?"
>
> "Duergar, Deep Gnomes, and Mountain Dwarves. Stay away from *Themberchaud's* Lair and **The Keepers of the Flame**."
>
> "*Themberchaud*?"
>
> "The Wyrmsmith of **Gracklstugh**. An ancient Red Dragon of unlimited appetite, though **The Keepers of the Flame** know how to satiate him," *Avren* says darkly.
>
> "How do you find your way?"
>
> "Oh, sometimes you can be friendly with the Kuo-toa, as long as you don't look like an easy victim. They are a bit mad, but know how to navigate **Darklake**, and they enjoy my music. They live in **Sloobludop**, and worship the Sea Mother."

*Avren* is full of useful information about the mushrooms of the **Underdark**, telling us which ones make water, wine, food, and other things.

We remember that we are here to hunt Fiends for the *Society of Brilliance* and discover how they are getting into the **Underdark**. We decide to take a cycle and fashion some more secure rafts. That cycle goes well! The team makes food and water from the mushrooms. *Avren* points out some mushrooms with orange and red stripes and says they are called “The Devil’s Mushrooms”, making a really strong red liquor that the Duergar like. *Calmul* busts out a still in a cloud of small, whirring, magical devices. No one is brave enough to drink the final product. We end up with 2 wine skins of the stuff, which *Avren* says will be worth a lot in **Gracklstugh**.

*Benjamin* decides to explore and finds 3 octopodes in the tops of the tree-like mushrooms *Avren* calls Zurkhwood. One of them floats off ... in fear? Another is chewing on a Stirge. I like that one. *Steve* attempts to catch it and but somehow it detects ultra-sneaky *Steve* and escapes. Now, all 3 are gone.

These are the occupants of the rafts:

Canoe 1 (2 people) - *Steve* and *Benjamin*

Canoe 2 (2 people) - *Tysnera* and *Viker*

Raft (10 people) - Me right in the middle, *Calmul* + Steel Defender, *CoralKing*, **Tasbros**, *Geral*, *Actias*, and *Wulrif*.

*Avren’s* Mushroom (1 person) - *Avren*

*Viker* decides to morph into a Shark to tow the rafts. She takes off at 35 MPH, knocking us over. *Tysnera* falls out of the raft. *Geral* cuts the rope from *Viker*, while *Wulrif* telepathically tells *Viker* that we lost *Tysnera*. After 10 minutes, *Tysnera* is back in her raft. We work out a way to tell *Viker* if things go wrong. She takes off again. We are really moving!

Sometime later, *Viker* smells prey, tainted with Fiendish overtones. Suddenly, large and small fishy-scaly things swarm our rafts!

> "Kuo-toa, not the friendly kind!" *Avren* shouts.
>
> "What are the big Uglies?" *Geral* asks.
>
> "Merrow! Servants of the *Deep Father*!" *Avren* replies.

Round 1

1. *Benjamin* uses Hunter's Sense on the Merrow. They are Monstrosities tainted by Fiends, and have no weaknesses. Worse, they are immune to being Charmed or Frightened.

9. A Kuo-toa throws a net over *Geral* but *Tysnera* uses Protective Wings as a reaction to cause the net to miss. Another attempts to throw a net over *Calmul’s* Steel Defender. The last one nets *Avren* and she is now restrained. I get hit by a Hold Person spell and become paralyzed.

10. The Kuo-toa Archpriest casts Mass Cure Wounds on all the creatures we damaged?!?
11. *Avren* casts Thunder Wave and hits 3 Kuo-toa (including the Archpriest), doing 18 damage to them and driving them away.
12. A Kuo-toa attempts to net *Tysnera*, but *Geral* hamstrings it with an attack of opportunity as it tries to get past him, sticking it in place. Yay!
13. *Tysnera* casts Fireball and does 37 HP damage to a Merrow and bunch of Kuo-toa. Yay!
14. The Kuo-toa with *Tasbros* stuck in it's polearm pulls him underwater. Boo!

Round 3

1. *Benjamin* shoots the Merrow in the head and does 22 HP damage.
2. *Tasbros* doesn't escape and didn't get a chance to hold his breath, so he is starting to drown.
3. *CoralKing* moves to the back of the raft and attacks one of the Merrow with his Staff of Striking, doing 25 HP damage. He also uses Flurry of Blows for 8 HP more damage.
4. I move to the nearest Kuo-toa with a Mancatcher and attack it twice, doing 33 HP damage, killing it.

8. *Viker* is no longer entangled and spits out the Archpriest to attack the Kuo-toa holding *Tasbros* underwater. BIG CHOMP! And *Tasbros* is saved!
9. The Archpriests that *Viker* was chewing on and attacking *Avren* decide to skedaddle.
10. *Avren* holds her action.
11. *Tysnera* holds her action.
12. *Tasbros* bursts to the surface, *Viker* eats the Kuo-toa and comes back to the surface to tow us away quickly before the banished Merrow pop back. This gives us enough time to take a short rest.

We keep going along and we see more Kuo-toa. They start swimming parallel to us, hailing us in Undercommon, which *CoralKing* and *Avren* understand.

> "Why did your people attack us?" asks *CoralKing*.
>
> "That was not us! Those were blasphemers who follow the *Deep Father*!" replies the Kuo-toa.
>
> "Who are you?" asks *CoralKing*.
>
> "I am *Ploopploopeen*, Archpriest of *Blibdoolpoolp*. We are the true followers of the *Sea Mother* and we will reward you if you help us fight these blasphemers. You look like you are trying to get up to the surface. We can help you get there."
>
> "Ask them why they want our help," says *Viker*. *CoralKing* translates.
>
> "We are the defenders of our faith," replies *Ploopploopeen*. "Long have the inhabitants of **Sloobludop** lived in harmonious service to the will of the *Sea Mother*. But recently, my own daughter *Bloppblippodd* experienced a powerful vision of

*CoralKing* gets the sense that they are telling the truth, but he can’t read their unblinking eyes and fishy expressions too well.

> "What do we get for helping you?" asks *CoralKing*.
>
> "We can show you the way to **Gracklstugh** by safe paths."
>
> "What is your plan?"
>
> "We will pretend to offer you to the followers of the *Deep Father* as a sacrifice, to mend our breach. Then, when you are at their Altar, we will attack."
>
> "What?!" says *Viker*, when *CoralKing* translates. *Geral* minutely shakes his head.
>
> "We will not give up our weapons," says *CoralKing*.
>
> "They will not care. They believe the *Deep Father* is irresistible. They will not expect you to fight back."
