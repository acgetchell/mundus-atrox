### Autumnset

#### From the journal of Countess Orky

We all hop on the airship to the **Gauntlgrym** mine. As we rise above the clouds, we can feel the changing of the season. From the deck of the airship, we watch the *Enclouding* dissipate into the wide blue skies of *Autumnset*, surmounted by the *Arch*.
We ponder the dangers of the upcoming *Winternight*.

The great gate of **Gauntlgrym** is huge. There are tons of Dwarves, tons of levels with twisting stairs, and passageways that Dragons could walk through. The whole place feels old and variably lit. Mine carts run by themselves. There are a couple of people on our ship that I don’t recognize.

We are kindly greeted at the gate and led to our quarters. Out of the corner of *Actias*’ and *Wulrif*’s eyes, they see Ghosts. We are told they won’t mess with us as long as we don’t desecrate the locations of their demise. We are also told to avoid the **Iron Tabernacle**, the cathedral. They said the king will see us when we have rested from our travels. We decide to short rest.

We are taken to meet a red-haired Dwarf and the magic users can feel a strong divine magic. I can feel a consecrated magic. He says “welcome friends, I want to know about the depths outside my city.” So, he discern that he wants to know about the underdark. We tell him about  the Koa-Toa summoning *Demogorgon*. We attempted to stop it, but failed and were forced to flee. We continued to update him on all of our travels until this point.

He said he recently reclaimed the kingdom from the Illithids. He said in the deeper levels, we shouldn't trust what we find. It’s rumored there is some sort of primordial creature guarding the lower levels. The weapons forged there are superior.

We remember the book *Wulrif* has can be a clue to *Basil*. So, we think if we can find his Patron, we might be able to find which realm he’s in. We figure out how to take a magical sleep to find him. In the meantime, we are summoned to dinner by some Dwarves. We are approached by a wealthy young lady who says she wants to speak with us privately. She walks away and we discuss if we should. We decide we should and follow her into a massive room off of the great hall.

She confirms that we are from **Neverwinter** and says we can trade information. She said she is from the *Zhentarim*. She wants to know the information that *King Bruenor* gives us, that he hasn’t given her. We agree and she leaves. We meander back to the feast and are met by a Dwarf that tells us the king wants to meet with us privately.

We follow the Dwarf again as he leads us down a labyrinth of halls. The king said he relayed our information and he wants to know more. He instructs us to find a people, who can lead us to a place, and they might give us some information. He said he will support us along the way.

We all stock up on various equipment and head out. We see snow falling on the mountains and feel the cold air. It’s perfectly dark outside. Our first few cycles are uneventful. Eventually, we suddenly encounter 8 trolls. *Benjamin* and I are surprised, while the rest of us aren’t.
