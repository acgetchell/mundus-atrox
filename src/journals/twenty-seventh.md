#### From the journal of Dame Orky

*CoralKing* decides he wants to go on his journey to **Phandalin** and talk to *Chiyo* about his BLOOD FURY tattoo. *Viker* transforms into a horse to carry *CoralKing* and I summon a steed so we get there faster. We ride by a herd of elephants and wave to them. They wave their trunks back at us.

We arrive in **Phandalin** and head to Tresendar Manor, where the Orcs are. They recognize us and *Viker* says “boo.” *CoralKing* said “greetings best friends.” They respond to “oh, the Gnome talks. What can we do for you lady Orky?” *CoralKing* said we are looking for “*Chiyo*” and they barely subside their fury. They said she is busy, but they would let her know we are looking for her. I tell them it’s a matter of great importance and smile. They cheerfully agree, ask us to wait in their foyer, and hastily run off. *Chiyo* appears and asks what we need. I explain that *CoralKing* is in need of a Blood Fury tattoo. She says “in need of?” and chuckles. I ask what we would need to fulfill that quest.

She says we would need to find someone with the skill to hold that pattern. *CoralKing* asks who could? She responds that she could, but she needs some things. We need to slay Icewing, who was the Dragon who exiled the Orcs. We could slay a black Dragon in Dead Man’s Marsh instead. She needs white Dragon and black Dragon blood to make the ink. She said we need access to her workshop for the tattoo, so we need to deal with Icewing for access since it’s lair is in her workshop. She said the tattoo would take 7 cycles and it needs to be done on Autumnset, when the shadowfell is open, which is in 200 hours.

We ask *Chiyo* how we can possibly beat these Dragons. She responds that her whole tribe couldn’t beat Icewing, so they don’t know. She cannot spare the troops and cannot recommend mercenaries. Benjamin tells us Icewing is slightly weaker than the black Dragon.

We decide there’s no way to take down any of the Dragons and decide to try and follow *Viker*’s quest instead. So, we head to **[Neverwinter]** to get more information. I petition as a **Templar** to stand before the inquisition. They agree to hear me. They offer me condolences. I ask why and they told me my father died. I have 3 cycles to present myself to the **Ledger** in **St. George’s Cathedral** to undergo a genetic scan. Then, they will analyze that my genetic pattern matches his and I will inherit his lands and titles to me, since my half brothers’ fell as well. This is about a 4 hour ceremony. I find out my father fell in **Icewind Dale** in battle against Frost Giants.

I present myself and meanwhile, *Viker* presents to the Inquisition. *Viker* notices the human woman is wearing a cloak covered in eyeballs. She tells her she has to root out some evil and prove herself to enter into the society. She asks how and the human tells her to find the **Illuminati** and the unguarded Teleportation Circles. *Viker* asks what they are like, she is told they are Shapeshifters by race. The human wants to know how they got here.

*CoralKing* figures out that magic items can be traced by their makers. *Viker* goes to the Cathedral with the ****Templar**. I join the group while *Viker* is trying to track down the **Illuminati**. I find *Harrod* and he congratulates me on my ascension with his condolences. I ask him if he knows of anything about the **Illuminati**. He tells me it has led some Templars astray and *CoralKing* can tell he is telling the truth. I ask if he will help us take down the **Illuminati** because I don’t have anyone else I can trust. He says *Lord Varkosian* had a lot of influence, but he trusts the head of our order. The head’s name is *Lord Sozenskaat*. I ask *Harrod* for an audience with the Lord. A cycle passes and we are ushered into his office. A light is in his room and it shines on the entire room. There are 2 suits of armor sitting nearby with slight clanking sounds and roaming muskets. I ask what he knows about the **Illuminati** and he tells me that he thinks they might be changelings, which are a constructed race with the innate ability to modify their bodies. Shapeshifters magic would be canceled by the Arclight. It’s not magic, but they were magically constructed to have that ability. He thinks changelings are doing this by taking 1 form and not changing that form while under the Arclight.

Changelings are fey or infernal. *Lord Varkosian* has proved that changelings are somewhere in the city. They don’t have families, but are identical in a given group. We call them clones or clades. He thinks we have a clade of infernal changelings. He doesn’t know how they got here but this is the time that **[Neverwinter]** is stationary and they would have had to make it past the Crusaders. He knows of the unguarded Teleportation Circles and the unguarded gateway summoned by *Lord Varkosian*. I ask if we should go after the unguarded circles. The other approach would be finding pulses of demonic activity in areas where the Arclight doesn’t shine in the lower levels. In addition, barriers are present. *Lord Varkosian* would have had to take them down. So, maybe see how that happened. We can talk to the Artificers guild, many of these areas are guarded by the constructs, where no living things go. The Artificers create the constructs.

I tell an Artificer that I am investigating weak spots in the defenses of **[Neverwinter]**. He seems flustered and speaks into a bunch of copper tubes. Then, suddenly a light appears in the distance. It becomes obvious I am supposed to follow it. We all follow and we see a military-themed office. We see a Gnome and he seems suspicious of *CoralKing*. I tell him that we have evidence of the defenses of **[Neverwinter]** being breached. He asks where we were when *Baphomet* was summoned. I can’t remember and neither can anyone else. He thinks it may have been an input grate with a filter, where they take things in from the outside. He asks if we were fighting on a conveyer belt and I say no. He said that narrows it down. I ask if he knows anywhere else to go or anyone else to talk to. He gives us 2 constructs to follow us. One moves very quickly and we follow it. *Viker* transforms into a horse fly and chases after it. She barely keeps up with it. We weave through the passageways and we are led to a conveyer belt with rocks and we see the Arclight reflected onto each belt. Except we see two light sources with a missing lenses. The constructs are confused. The conveyer belt that is unilluminated is bringing up debris, but we also notice something moving on it. We see 4 earth monsters and a coffin opening up with a blood-thirsty creature approaching. I know Vampires can’t go to any place that they are not invited, but they can enter locations where no one lives…

Round 1

1. *CoralKing* hits one of the earth creatures for 26 HP damage.
2. *Viker* casts sunbeam on the 4 creatures and the Vampire. She does 21 HP damage on the earth monsters and 30 HP on the Vampire.

Round 2

Round 3

1. *CoralKing* hits the earth creature with his Staff of Striking and does 7 HP damage.
