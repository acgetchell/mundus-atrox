### Summerday +1316 hours

#### From the journal of Countess Orky

We slowly move forward toward the commotion. *Viker* turns into a fly and investigates what’s going on. *Wulrif* uses telepathy to transmit her vision to the rest of us. She reports back that she sees a huge battle going on with several globes of darkness that are snatching up initiates with tentacles and dragging them into the darkness. There are 12 globes surrounding a central globe. We see *Brother Basil* run into the central darkness globe. This is strange because the **Arclight** is active and shining on this area.

Round 1

1. *CoralKing* readies his action.
2. I ready my action.
3. *Wulrif* casts scatter on us into the central darkness globe. He tried to pull us into the sphere, but we bounced off in different directions. *CoralKing* landed in one of the spheres. He senses something in there with him. He gets hit twice with slimy tentacles, is grappled, and incapacitated (can’t take actions or reactions). He takes a total of 62 HP damage. He feels like the tentacles are probing around his face and tearing at his skull. He feels that he is close to death.
4. Tentacles begin attacking the rest of us for 3 HP damage. Suddenly, all globes disappear except the ones near us 4. We notice 2 bodies appear where 2 of the globes were. They are missing the tops of their heads and their brains are exposed.
5. *Viker* assumes her normal shape and casts investiture of wind (telekinesis rules), knocking *CoralKing* out of the darkness.

Round 2

1. *CoralKing* is no longer incapacitated. He stands up and moves near me.
2. I ready my action.
3. *Wulrif* looks at the Warlock’s book and notices some smoke emanating from it. He casts use an object to read it and reads through it to get rid of the darkness globes. They disappear and each drop a body. The body dropped in the center was the one of the necromancer, the guy who we tasked with arresting *Brother Basil* earlier. He continues to investigate the Warlock’s book. He found traces of the Far Realm and decided the creatures who were responsible for this magic were aberrations. He notices that there is a familiar way these brains are scooped. He finds that they were attacked by Illithids (Mind Flayers) in order to gain their memories. They can’t just appear anywhere, they need some sort of anchor to manifest here. The tome was used to make an anchor, but the anchor is gone.

We investigate the city for days to try to find any security breaches, but are unsuccessful. We decide *Brother Basil* was the one allowing the creatures in. Since he is gone, there is no risk of them returning. I have long telepathic conversations with *Lord Varkosian* about this situation. The affair he had, which resulted in a bastard, made him feel guilty enough to drive a wedge between him and his wife. *Brother Basil* was also strange. He had 2 personalities, a kind one, and a trickster one that was what he used to do his dark activities.

I report for my official swearing in as a Templar, and instead of being assigned to a group of 13 (tridectet), I was allowed to maintain my current station in order to keep investigating the **Far Realm** threat. I was told my group might have better skills to solve the issue.

*CoralKing* is slipped a note about joining a brotherhood. I have a manor on level 5, and *Wulrif* sets off to work on setting up a teleportation circle there, in case we need it. *CoralKing* finds a note in his pocket. He reads the note and it disintegrates. We ask what it said and he responds “Hello, Brother.”, written in common. We decide the paper is a wrapper that comes from a machine on level 2. *Wulrif* locks and protects the area of the teleportation circle.

We decide to make our way down to level 2 with the farmers, Franciscan abbey, warehouses, and laborers. *CoralKing* wants to go to the warehouses and ask the workers if they know of anything about the wrapper he is holding. The worker points out the nearby papermill. He said they wrap food with those wrappers. *CoralKing* asks if anyone is seeking new members of groups. He hesitates that the warehouse is always looking for new workers, but he isn’t sure it’s fit for his skillset. He notices some warehouse robots moving about. He goes up to the driver to ask about the robots and is scolded for being in the way. He jumps out of the way just in time. *Wulrif* looks around for an individual who is paying too much attention to *CoralKing*, but doesn't notice anyone.  

*CoralKing* finds another note in his pocket. He reads it aloud: “4th shift, come alone or don’t bother. $#$%RYWH^T%$HHQ#%” he asks when the 4th shift begins, and the foreman responds 1800-2400. So, we travel up to have a nice brunch together. He notices the unintelligible part of the note now reads an address. *CoralKing* leaves for his meeting.

He approaches the door, and the door slides open. The inside is dark, but he can see. It’s a worker’s quarters and somewhat small. He says “Is there anyone here?” and a voice appears in his head “WTF, why are you screaming?!? You’re supposed to be inconspicuous.” He moves forward and finds himself at the center of the room. He whispers “who’s here?” they respond “We are.” he asks “what do you need?” they respond “What can you do for us?”  “Well, I have a group-” and they cut off “yes, we know about the goodie-two-shoes, but what can you do for us?” he said “anything that is required” “how do you feel about your friends?” “they are my friends.” “We aren't asking you to betray them, but people of our stature don't garner much respect. You've been somewhere we are interested in. It's pretty far beneath us” “What awaits you in the underdark?” “We have business there from time-to-time” “What stops you from entering the underdark?” “What says we don't? You have experience there and that might be useful for our business.” “we will be in touch and you might explain what kind of benefit you provide to our organization. We can give you items and help occasionally,  preventing us from being overlooked. We like what we see of you so far. We will give you something and see you again.”

Suddenly *CoralKing* sees a ring gleaming on a bed in front of him. “Wait! You say you are overlooked, how would you like to be perceived by others?” “We would like our fair share and certain interests to be looked after. No one else will look after them.” “Is there any way I can help with these interests?” “Of course, once we trust you and are sure it won't cause conflict with your friends.” “Is there anything we have done that is untrustworthy?” “No, or we wouldn't be talking.”

He grabs the ring and slides it in his pocket. He leaves and heads back to the manor. He asks Tysnera if she will investigate the ring for him. She said it appears to be a ring of telekinesis, which is very rare. He puts it on, attunes to it, and feels a strange ability now.

*Wulrif* investigates the book again and finds it’s similar, but opposite to his patron.
