### Summerday +516 hours

#### From the journal of Dame Orky

We start by searching the grounds and the cathedral. We find a gift box containing 1200 gp, 13 gems (1000 gp each). We split them evenly and offer *Chiyo* and *Gruumsh, Clanleader of the Icebreakers* 2 gems for their help. We also find a staff, sword, a book, and a rod. *Tysnera* identifies the book as a tome of understanding and we give that to *Viker*. The rod is a rod of absorption and we hand it to *Tasbros*. The Staff of Striking goes to *CoralKing*. The dancing Shortsword goes to *Actias*. The Orcs mentioned killing a bunch of vampires. We dispose of the remnants.

> Chiyo gestures towards *Geral*, her deep red eyes contemplative and searching.
>
> She negligently waves her hand, and a curtain of darkness surrounds her and *Geral*.
>
> The rest of the group startles a bit. Gruumsh laughs uproariously.
>
> "Had my wife wished to snack upon his marrow," he declaims, "She would have done it shortly after our fight with the demons."
>
> He winks.
>
> "She gets hungry after working magic."
>
> "He's okay," says *Wulrif*, concentrating a bit from his litter. The group relaxes, still a bit unsettled in the company of so many Orcs and Ogres.
>
> *Steve* discreetly slips a dagger back into its sheathe. *Calmul*'s Steel Guardian relaxes from the taut vibrancy of a coiled steel spring, resuming a watchful aspect.
>
> "Mortals words are worthless, *Thane Bryn*" says *Chiyo*, seemingly oblivious to the clamor around her.
"You have offered my husband assurances of shelter and loot, but how am I to believe your bond to him will hold once we are amongst your kind?"
"You have something in mind,"  replies *Geral*.
*Chiyo* smiles her unsettling tusked grin, her red eyes gleaming. She holds up a six-inch needle, tiny in her hands.
>
> "My people tattoo mutual bonds upon their flesh. If you are true to its inscription, it guards your life. If not ..."
>
> "What inscription?"
>
> "You tell me." *Chiyo* smiles appraisingly.

We need to get the ward stone into our wagon. We decide to use *Tasbros*’ Telekinesis to lift it into our wagon. As we do this, we see a bird circling, it lands and turns into this little masked person. His mask is half happy and half sad. He starts giving us shit about how fucked up the ward stone is. We use detect magic and see he’s magic. He asks us if we know how ward stones work. *Actias* asks what his intentions are and he just laughs. *Wulrif* tries to read his mind and it’s strangely missing. *Viker* invites him to join us on our journey back to Phandalin and calls him old, which pisses him off. He grows and starts rearing up at us. We ask what we can do to keep him happy. He said we will amuse him, he snaps his fingers and the skies start to darken. He snaps his fingers again and we feel the ground start to shake. Then, this massive toothed worm breaks out of the ground behind the group.

7. He waves his hand and a telekinetic force slams into *Tysnera*, blasting her into the girth hole behind us, doing 24 HP damage. She makes her CON saving throw, but is still falling.
8. I try casting Hold Person, and fail. I declare a Vow of Enmity.

*Tasbros* makes a web at the bottom of this girth hole. We land on the web on the bottom of this girth hole. We are in a cavern with fungus. Welcome to the **Underdark**, bitches.

*Tasbros* contracts short-term madness and falls unconscious for 7 minutes. He seems fine, but has a sort of twitch to him now. *Tysnera* detects a fiendish magic everywhere around us. We walk for 2 cycles and find a stream. I fill up my water skin and stand watch while everyone else drinks water. I finally see 9 fat, 2-headed, knuckle-dragging figures approaching. *Viker* says “hello friend” in Ork. They respond “small food, let’s get em boys!” and attack.
