## Adamantium

Adamantium is the hardest known substance on **Mundus**. A black non-metallic substance, it is extremely hard while being light and flexible. It can only be worked by [Artificers](artificer.md).

Weapons made of Adamantium are [Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/equipment#WeaponProperties), and cause [Critical Hits] on a roll of 19 or 20.

Armor made of Adamantium is half the weight and one [category](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/equipment#ArmorandShields) lighter than normal[^1], and the wearer is immune to [Critical Hits].

[^1] For example, Adamantium Plate Mail only weighs 32 lbs, and counts as Medium, rather than Heavy, Armor. Other attributes such as required strength and disadvantage on Stealth are not affected, as these are due to the bulk, rather than weight of armor.
