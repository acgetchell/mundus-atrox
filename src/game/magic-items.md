## Adamantium

Black and non-metallic, *Adamantium* is the hardest known substance on **Mundus**. *Adamantium* seems to drink in the light, and is non-reactive to both fire and acid.
*Adamantium* is highly prized for it's lightness and durability, and can only be worked by [Artificers](artificer.md).

Weapons made of *Adamantium* cause [Critical Hits] on a roll of 19 or 20.

Armor made of *Adamantium* is half the weight, and the wearer is immune to [Critical Hits].
