## Feats

Some races have racially-specific *Feats*:

- **Dragon Fear**: The Dragonborn increases Strength, Constitution, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
Instead of exhaling destructive energy, you can expend a use of your Breath Weapon trait to roar, forcing each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). A target automatically succeeds on the save if it can’t hear or see you. On a failed save, a target becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. If the frightened target takes any damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

- **Dwarven Fortitude**: The Dwarf increases Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
Whenever you take the Dodge action in combat, you can spend one Hit Die to heal yourself. Roll the die, add your Constitution modifier, and regain a number of hit points equal to the total (minimum of 1).

- **Wood Elf Magic**: You learn the magic of the primeval woods, which are revered and protected by your people. You learn one druid cantrip of your choice. You also learn the *longstrider* and *pass without trace* spells, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast these two spells in this way when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for all three spells.

- **Orcish Fury**: The Half-Orc increases Strength or Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
When you hit with an attack using a simple or martial weapon, you can roll one of the weapon’s damage dice an additional time and add it as extra damage of the weapon’s damage type. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
Immediately after you use your Relentless Endurance trait, you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack.

- **Second Chance**: The Halfling increases Dexterity, Constitution, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
When a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to force that creature to reroll. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you roll initiative at the start of combat or until you finish a short or long rest.

- **Human Prodigy**: You gain one skill proficiency of your choice, one tool proficiency of your choice, and fluency in one language of your choice.
Choose one skill in which you have proficiency. You gain expertise with that skill, which means your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with it. The skill you choose must be one that isn’t already benefiting from a feature, such as Expertise, that doubles your proficiency bonus.

- **Fade Away**: The Gnome increases Dexterity or Intelligence by 1, to a maximum of 20. Immediately after you take damage, you can use a reaction to magically become invisible until the end of your next turn or until you attack, deal damage, or force someone to make a saving throw. Once you use this ability, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

- **Fey Teleportation**: The Otherkin increases Intelligence or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
You learn the *misty step* spell and can cast it once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a short or long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
