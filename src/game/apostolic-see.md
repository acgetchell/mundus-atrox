# Apostolic See

The Apostolic See is the formal religion of the Urbs, based upon the worship of the Holy Trinity. The Apostolic See is a hierarchical organization, composed of Clerics (Clergy) and non-Clerics (Laity). The hierarchy is as follows:

- Presbyter (Cleric)
  - Deacon (Laity)
- Bishop (Cleric)
  - Archdeacon (Laity)
- Archbishop (Cleric)
  - Vicar (Laity)
- Cardinal (Cleric)
  - Legate (Laity)

Each **Cathedral** is led by a Presbyter and governed by a Deacon. Cathedrals within a geographic area are grouped into a **Diocese**, which are led by a Bishop and governed by an Archdeacon. **Dioceses** are grouped into ecclesiastical **Provinces**,
under the leadership of the Bishop of a particular **Diocese**, which is called the **Metropolitan** or Archdiocese. The Bishop of the Metropolitan is an Archbishop, and the Archdiocese is governed by the Vicar. The Metropolitans gather every so often
to elect a Cardinal, who is the spiritual leader of the Apostolic See. The Cardinal then appoints a Legate as the secular leader of the Apostolic See.

In addition to the Clergy and Laity, the Apostolic See has several other organizations.
