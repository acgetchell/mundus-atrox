# Equipment

Your starting equipment and gold are determined by your class and background. You don't roll for gold. You may start with a trinket of your choice
from available rules choices. You can sell starting equipment using the rules in the Player's Handbook and can buy equipment and spell components found in the Player's Handbook or available in the campaign.

In addition to the standard [Equipment] list, a variety of exotic items are in common use on **Mundus**.
