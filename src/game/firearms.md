# Firearms

The most common firearms found on **Mundus** are *Muskets* and *Pistols*, but [other types](../background/artifacts.md) have been discovered.

[Elves](../background/elves.md) disdain the use of *Firearms*, but the [Artificers](artificer.md) in the [Urbs](../background/urbs.md)
and [Mines](../background/mines.md) commonly manufacture them, with the *Protectors* and *Iron Guard* being notable for use of *Firearms*
throughout their ranks.

Firearms require 10 rounds to reload per barrel. A person with *Proficiency* in Firearms can reload a barrel in 5 rounds.
Someone with the [Gunner Feat] can reload a barrel and fire once per round.

The *Quattour* and *Octo* may discharge all their barrels in a single round. In this instance, the firer receives *Disadvantage* unless they possess
the [Gunner Feat]. Success produces d4/d8 hits.

An [Artificer](artificer.md) that [Infuses] a *Firearm* with [Repeating Shot] can reload and fire up to two shotgun barrels or four single shot barrels
per round.
