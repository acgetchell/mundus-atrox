The most common firearms found on **Mundus** are *Muskets* and *Pistols*, but [other types](../background/artifacts.md) have been discovered.

[Elves](../background/elves.md) disdain the use of *Firearms*, but [Artificers](artificer.md) in the [Urbs](../background/urbs.md)
and [Mines](../background/mines.md) commonly manufacture them, with the *Protectors* and *Iron Guard* being notable users
throughout their ranks.

## Common Types

## Use

A *Pistol* or *Musket* discharges one lead ball per round.

Shotguns discharge a number of pellets per round.

The *Quattour* and *Octo* may discharge all their barrels in a single round. In this instance, the firer receives *Disadvantage* unless they possess
the [Gunner Feat]. Success produces d4/d8 hits.

## Reloading

Firearms require 10 rounds to reload per barrel. A person with *Proficiency* in Firearms can reload a barrel in 5 rounds.
Someone with the [Gunner Feat] can reload a barrel as an [Action] and fire as a Bonus Action.

An [Artificer](artificer.md) that [Infuses] a *Firearm* with [Repeating Shot] can reload and fire up to two shotgun barrels or four single shot barrels
per round. In this case, the +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls does not apply. The ammunition is assembled from components in the possession of the
[Artificer](artificer.md) (e.g. ball and powder).

## Armor Effects
