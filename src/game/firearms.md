# Firearms

The most common firearms found on **Mundus** are Muskets and Pistols, but [other types](../background/artifacts.md) have been discovered.

[Elves](../background/elves.md) disdain the use of *Firearms*, but the [Artificers](artificer.md) in the [Urbs](../background/urbs.md)
and [Mines](../background/mines.md) commonly manufacture them, the *Protectors* and the *Iron Guard* being notable users throughout their ranks.
