# Spellcasting

To cast a spell, a character requires three things:

## Spell Knowledge and Preparation

[Arcane Tricksters], [Artificers], [Bards], [Eldritch Knights], [Rangers], [Sorcerers], [Warlocks], and [Wizards] must know and/or prepare spell formula
to cast spells.

These formulae take different forms, depending upon the discipline of the spell-caster, and usually do not translate across classes.

*Example: the spell formula for Magic Missile written by [Wizards] is different from the [Sorcerers] Magic Missile.*

Some classes, like the [Artificer](artificer.md), can change known spells by tinkering with their spellcasting focus. Other classes, like [Wizards], write down formulae in their spellbooks. The number of known spells can exceed the number of prepared spells.

[Arcane Tricksters] and [Wizards] must prepare spells from their list of known spells.

**Only prepared spells can be cast.**

[Clerics], [Druids], [Sorcerers], and [Wizards] can prepare a number of spells equal to their Spellcasting Attribute bonus + class level.

*Example: A 5th-level Wizard with an Intelligence of 16 can prepare 8 spells.*

[Artificers] and [Paladins] can prepare a number of spells equal to their Spellcasting Attribute bonus + half their class level, rounded down.

*Example: A 3rd-level Paladin with a Charisma of 17 can prepare 4 spells.*

[Arcane Tricksters], [Bards], [Eldritch Knights], [Rangers], and [Warlocks] have a fixed number of prepared spells depending on their level.

*Example: A 5th-level Warlock can prepare 6 spells, regardless of Charisma.*

## Spell Level

**Second, the character must be able to channel magical ability of that level.**

*Example: a 5th-level Wizard can channel up to 3rd-level spells.*

## Mana

**Lastly, the character must have available [Mana].**


Using [Mana] often requires *Verbal*, *Somatic*, and/or *Material* components, which are consumed when [Mana] is expended.
If these words, gestures, or materials are interrupted or interfered with, the spell fizzles and the [Mana] is lost.

## Environmental Effects

Spells which use an [Attack Roll] normally generate [Critical Hits] on a roll of 20.

*Example: Call Lightning does not trigger [Critical Hits], because it has a Saving Throw.*

Certain spells have enhanced effects in certain environments, as follows:

A spell causing damage matching the environment generates a Critical Hit on a 19 or 20 [Attack Roll].
Likewise, [Saving Throws] are at Disadvantage.

| Damage Type | Environmental Enhanced Effect |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| Radiant     | [Summerday] |
| Necrotic    | [Winternight] |
| Acid        | Acid Rain |
| Cold        | Blizzard |
| Lightning   | Thunderstorm |
| Thunder     | Thunderstorm |
| Fire        | Active volcano |
| Force       | *The Arch* is visible |

*Example: A roll of 19 with a [Javelin of Lightning] during a Thunderstorm triggers a Critical Hit on the target for 2d6 Piercing + 8d6 Lightning.
The creatures between the thrower and the target do not receive [Critical Hits], but they make a Dexterity Save for half damage at Disadvantage.*

[Wild Magic] [Sorcerers] trigger a [Wild Magic] Surge on a spellcasting [Attack Roll] of 20.

*Example: A Wild Magic Sorcerer rolls a 20 to Critical Hit a target with a Ray of Enfeeblement during Winternight.
He also triggers a Wild Magic Surge.*
