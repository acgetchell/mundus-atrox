# Spellcasting

To cast a spell, a character requires three things:

## Spell Knowledge and Preparation

*Arcane Tricksters*, [Artificers], *Bards*, *Eldritch Knights*, *Rangers*, *Sorcerers*, *Warlocks*, and *Wizards* must know and prepare the spell formula.

These formulae take different forms, depending upon the discipline of the spell-caster, and usually do not translate across classes.

Example: the spell formula for *Magic Missile* written by a *Wizard* is different from the *Sorcerer's* *Magic Missile*.

Some classes, like the [Artificer](artificer.md), can change known spells by tinkering with their spellcasting focus. Other classes, like *Wizards*, write down formulae in their spellbooks.

## Spell Level

Second, the character must be able to channel magical ability of that level.

Example: a 5th-level Wizard can channel up to 3rd-level spells.

## Mana

*Mana*, regardless of provenance, powers magic, and the character must have it to cast spells.

Using *Mana* often requires *Verbal*, *Somatic*, and/or *Material* components, which are consumed when *Mana* is expended.

Spellcasters have *Mana* as part of their **Being**. To determine how much, for each *Spell Slot* multiply by *Spell Level* and add up the total. This is summarized in the tables below.[^1]

Example: a 4th level Wizard has 10 *Mana* (4 1st-level slots x 1 + 3 2nd-level slots x 2 = 10).

Spells cost *Mana* equal to their level, plus any modifiers to that level.

Example: *Fireball* (a 3rd-level spell) cast with an additional 2d6 damage (10d6 total) costs 5 *Mana*.

*Cantrips* and other *At Will* abilities do not consume *Mana* directly, as they are powered by the **Being**.
Certain classes also have spells that are *Always Prepared* and do not count against Spell Slots.
In this case, *Always Prepared* spells are added to the *Known Spell* list, and their *Spell Level* is added to the *Mana* for the character.

[Ritual Spells] require *Mana* equal to their level available to begin the ritual, but the spellcaster attunes the spell to the *Mana* of the environment.
Thus, it does not deplete the spellcaster's *Mana* directly.

[^1]: The tables gives slightly more spell points than a straight conversion, to provide increasing Mana per level.

[^2]: *Clerics* and *Wizards* have +1 Cantrips, *Sorcerers* have +2 Cantrips.

[^3]: *Sorcerers* get *Metamagic Mana* equal to their level, which can be used for [Metamagic] or *Mana*.

[^4]: *Artificers* know Cantrips equal to *Druids*, and at 1st level know 1st level spells with 2 Mana.
