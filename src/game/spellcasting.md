# Spellcasting

To cast a spell, a character requires three things:

## Spell Knowledge and Preparation

[Arcane Tricksters], [Artificers], [Bards], [Eldritch Knights], [Rangers], [Sorcerers], [Warlocks], and [Wizards] must know and prepare the spell formula.

These formulae take different forms, depending upon the discipline of the spell-caster, and usually do not translate across classes.

Example: the spell formula for *Magic Missile* written by [Wizards] is different from the [Sorcerers] *Magic Missile*.

Some classes, like the [Artificer](artificer.md), can change known spells by tinkering with their spellcasting focus. Other classes, like [Wizards], write down formulae in their spellbooks.

## Spell Level

Second, the character must be able to channel magical ability of that level.

Example: a 5th-level Wizard can channel up to 3rd-level spells.

## Mana

Lastly, the character must have available [Mana].
Using [Mana] often requires *Verbal*, *Somatic*, and/or *Material* components, which are consumed when [Mana] is expended.

## Environmental Effects

Spells which use an [Attack Roll] generate [Critical Hits] on a roll of 20.

Radiant [damage type] spells or effects generate [Critical Hits] on a roll of 19 or 20 during [Summerday](../background/seasons.md).

Necrotic [damage type] spells or effects generate [Critical Hits] on a roll of 19 or 20 during [Winternight](../background/seasons.md).

Acid [damage type] spells or effects generate [Critical Hits] on a roll of 19 or 20 during *Acid Rains*.

Cold [damage type] spells or effects generate [Critical Hits] on a roll of 19 or 20 during *Blizzards*.

Lightning and Thunder [damage type] spells or effects generate [Critical Hits] on a roll of 19 or 20 during *Thunderstorms*.

Fire [damage type] spells or effects generate [Critical Hits] on a roll of 19 or 20 during *Volcanic Eruptions*.

Force [damage type] spells or effects generate [Critical Hits] on a roll of 19 or 20 when *The Arch* is visible.

[Wild Magic] [Sorcerers] trigger a [Wild Magic] Surge on a spellcasting [Attack Roll] of 20.
