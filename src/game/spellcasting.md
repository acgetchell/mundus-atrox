# Spellcasting

To cast a spell, a character requires three things:

## Spell Knowledge and Preparation

[Arcane Tricksters], [Artificers], [Bards], [Eldritch Knights], [Rangers], [Sorcerers], [Warlocks], and [Wizards] must know and prepare spell formula
to cast spells.

These formulae take different forms, depending upon the discipline of the spell-caster, and usually do not translate across classes.

*Example: the spell formula for Magic Missile written by [Wizards] is different from the [Sorcerers] Magic Missile.*

Some classes, like the [Artificer](artificer.md), can change known spells by tinkering with their spellcasting focus. Other classes, like [Wizards], write down formulae in their spellbooks. Usually, the number of known spells exceeds the number of prepared spells.

**Only known spells can be prepared.**

**Only prepared spells can be cast.**

[Clerics], [Druids], [Sorcerers], and [Wizards] can prepare a number of spells equal to their Spellcasting Attribute bonus + class level.

*Example: A 5th-level Wizard with an Intelligence of 16 can prepare 8 spells.*

[Artificers] and [Paladins] can prepare a number of spells equal to their Spellcasting Attribute bonus + half their class level, rounded down.

*Example: A 3rd-level Paladin with a Charisma of 17 can prepare 4 spells.*

[Arcane Tricksters], [Bards], [Eldritch Knights], [Rangers], and [Warlocks] have a fixed number of prepared spells depending on their level.

*Example: A 5th-level Warlock can prepare 6 spells, regardless of Charisma.*

## Spell Level

**Second, the character must be able to channel magical ability of that level.**

*Example: a 5th-level Wizard can channel up to 3rd-level spells.*

## Mana

**Lastly, the character must have available [Mana].**


Using [Mana] often requires *Verbal*, *Somatic*, and/or *Material* components, which are consumed when [Mana] is expended.
If these words, gestures, or materials are interrupted or interfered with, the spell fizzles and the [Mana] is lost.

## Environmental Effects

Spells which use an [Attack Roll] generate [Critical Hits] on a roll of 20.

*Example: Call Lightning does not trigger [Critical Hits], because it has a Saving Throw.*

Radiant [damage type] spells or effects generate [Critical Hits] on a roll of 19 or 20 during [Summerday](../background/seasons.md).

Necrotic [damage type] spells or effects generate [Critical Hits] on a roll of 19 or 20 during [Winternight](../background/seasons.md).

Acid [damage type] spells or effects generate [Critical Hits] on a roll of 19 or 20 during *Acid Rains*.

Cold [damage type] spells or effects generate [Critical Hits] on a roll of 19 or 20 during *Blizzards*.

Lightning and Thunder [damage type] spells or effects generate [Critical Hits] on a roll of 19 or 20 during *Thunderstorms*.

Fire [damage type] spells or effects generate [Critical Hits] on a roll of 19 or 20 near *Active Volcanoes*.

Force [damage type] spells or effects generate [Critical Hits] on a roll of 19 or 20 when *The Arch* is visible.

*Example: A roll of 19 with a [Javelin of Lightning] during a Thunderstorm triggers a Critical Hit on the target for 2d6 Piercing + 8d6 Lightning.
However, those creatures between the thrower and the target do not receive [Critical Hits], because they make a Dexterity Save for half damage.*

[Wild Magic] [Sorcerers] trigger a [Wild Magic] Surge on a spellcasting [Attack Roll] of 20.

*Example: A Wild Magic Sorcerer rolls a 20 to Critical Hit a target with a Ray of Enfeeblement during Winternight.
He also triggers a Wild Magic Surge.*
