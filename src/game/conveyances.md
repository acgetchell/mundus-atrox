# Conveyances

There are a variety of ways to get around, starting with animal-based:

- [Hippogriff]
- [Horse]
- Manta Ray
- [Pegasus]
- Thunder Beast

There is also techno-magical transportation:

- [Airship]
- Crawler
- Horseless carriage
- Strider
- Submarine

Magical portals, temporary or otherwise, are also known to exist.

And of course, [Castelas](../background/castelas.md) and [Urbs](../background/urbs.md) are conveyances in their own right.
