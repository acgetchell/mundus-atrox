# Conveyances

There are a variety of ways to get around, starting with animal-based:

- [Horse]
- Thunder Beast
- [Hippogriff]
- [Pegasus]
- Manta Ray

There is also techno-magical transportation:

- Horseless carriage
- Strider
- Crawler
- [Airship]
- Submarine

Magical portals, temporary or otherwise, are also known to exist.

And of course, [Urbs](../background/urbs.md) and [Castelas](../background/castelas.md) are conveyances in their own right.
