# Starting

Here is some information to help you create a character for play in **Mundus**.

We will be using the materials from the [D&D Adventurers League](https://dnd.wizards.com/adventurers-league). The following is a summary; see the [Player's Guide] for more details.

## Step 0: Choose Your Campaign

This one is easy, we're playing in **[Mundus]**.

## Step 1: Choose a Race or Lineage

A rather large list of playable races are available, generally grouped into [Barbaria], [Fey], [Old Ones], and [Populi], though some [Dragon] and [Giant] lineages exist.

- [Playable Races](races.md)

## Step 2: Choose a Class

Available classes are listed [here](classes.md).

- No multi-classing allowed

## Step 3: Determine Ability Scores

- Standard set (**15**, **14**, **13**, **12**, **10**, **9**)
- Variant: [Customizing Ability Scores]

There are two additional Ability Scores, [Honor] and [Sanity]. They are based off of [Charisma] and [Wisdom] respectively, and are thereafter independent.

## Step 4: Describe Your Character

- **Alignment:** Choose a non-evil alignment.
- **Background:** Choose a background from the Player's Handbook or any other published source. If you choose a background that does not grant a feat, you may choose one of the following feats for your character: **Skilled** or **Tough**.
- **Deity:** Clerics are members of the [Apostolic See](apostolic-see.md).
- **Faction:** Factions are listed [here](factions.md).

## Step 5: Choosing Equipment

## Additional Rules

### Timekeeping

Daytime and nighttime are about 60 cycles, each of 24 hours. This corresponds with the seasons which are called *Summerday* and *Winternight* respectively.
In between *Summerday* and *Winternight* is the *Autumnset* cycle; in between *Winternight* and *Summerday* is the *Springrise* cycle.

- 1 Long Rest per cycle
  - Missing a long rest during a cycle causes [Exhaustion]
- 2 Short Rests per cycle

### Hero Dice

Characters have **Hero Dice** equal to their level.

**Hero Dice** once used are gone, but the character gains a new set upon reaching a new level.

**Hero Dice** may be added to an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw by the character after the roll is made, but before the results are applied.

Additionally, **Hero Dice** may be used to turn a failed Death Saving Throw into a success.

The type of **Hero Dice** depends upon the level of the character, according to the following table:

| Level Range | Hero Dice Type |
| ----------- | -------------- |
|  1 -  4     |  d4            |
|  5 - 10     |  d6            |
| 11 - 15     |  d8            |
| 16 - 18     |  d10           |
| 19 - 20     |  d12           |
