# Starting

Here is some information to help you create a character for play in **Mundus**.

## Ability scores

Generate *4* Ability Goups, choose your favorite. [DnDBeyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com) can do this electronically.

There are two additional Ability Scores, [Honor] and [Sanity]. They are based off of [Charisma] and [Wisdom] respectively, and thereafter are independent.

### Ability Groups

Roll 4d6 for each characteristic, take best 3 dice, arrange scores as desired.

## Classes

- [Character Classes][classes]
- No multi-classing.

## Equipment

## Hero Dice

At 5th level, characters gain **Hero Dice** equal to half their level. **Hero Dice** once used are gone, but the character gains a new set upon achieving a new level.

**Hero Dice** may be added to an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw after the roll is made, but before the results are applied.

Additionally, **Hero Dice** may be used to turn a failed Death Saving Throw into a success.

The type of **Hero Dice** depends upon the level of the character, according to the following table:

| Level Range | Hero Dice Type |
| ----------- | -------------- |
|  5 - 10     |  d6            |
| 11 - 15     |  d8            |
| 16 - 18     |  d10           |
| 19 - 20     |  d12           |

## Level

*Level 1*, or minimum XP for *Level - 1* from the [current party](../journals/overview.md) average (currently 10th).

## Races
