# Artificer

*Artificers* are described in [Tasha's Cauldron of Everything](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe/artificer#Artificer).

Most *Artificers* on **Mundus** belong to the *Artificers Guild*. Members of the *Artificers' Guild* speak to each other in a highly technical
language that sounds like *Common* but is full of outlandish words with little meaning to outsiders. *Artificers' Guild* members can recognize
each other via this *Artificers' Cant*.

 As *Artificers* are present in all centers of
[Civilization](../background/civilization.md), they are highly valued and protected by the *Artificers' Guild* (as
long as they are members of good standing). Naturally, the *Artificers' Guild* frowns upon non-Guild practicioners, but such folk are in demand
and do quite well trading or living amongst the [Barbaria](../background/barbaria.md).

## Hit Points

*Hit Dice*: 1d8 per Artificer level

*Hit Points at 1st Level*: 8 + Constitution modifier

*Hit Points at Higher Levels*: 1d8 (or 5) + Constitution modifier per level after 1st

## Proficiencies

*Armor*: Light armor, medium armor, shields

*Weapons*: Simple weapons, [Firearms]

*Tools*: Thieves' Tools, Tinkers' Tools, one type of Artisans' Tools

*Saving Throws*: Intelligence, Constitution

*Skills*: Choose two from *Arcana*, *History*, *Investigation*, *Medicine*, *Nature*, *Perception*, *Sleight of Hand*

## Spellcasting

Spells "cast" by an *Artificer* involve wonders and outlandish inventions, and either *Thieves' Tools* or *Artisans' Tools* are always
required as a *Material* component to the spell. Once [Infuse Item] is attained at 2nd level, any item bearing an *Infusion* may be used
as a spellcasting focus.

Intelligence is used as the *Artificers* spellcasting ability.
