# Peerage

Property-owning nobility exist in all Civilizations, and titles are often hereditary. The exact holdings and ancestry are encoded in the **Ledger of the Peerage**, sometimes referred to by the Benedictines as the **Blockchain** for reasons lost to time.
The **Ledger** is a kind of distributed magical artifact that associates the Title of a Holding with the genetic information of the current holder, indeed, the very definition of being a member of the Peerage is someone listed in the **Ledger**.

## Ledger

Each Castela, Mine, and Urb has it's own copy of the **Ledger**, which is an immutable history of all all titles held by all nobles in all cultures on **Mundus**. The records of the **Ledger** stretch backwards in time for thousands of generations, and the vast amount of records in the **Ledger** means that only the largest of Castelas, Mines, and Urbs have the resources to maintain an entire copy of the **Ledger**. Competing claims are often proposed in different copies of the **Ledger**, which is resolved by a kind of magical consensus based upon the number of copies of the **Ledger** that agree with a particular claim. Thus, successful claims are most often registered in the largest Castelas, Mines, and Urbs.

## Castelan Titles

Elven Nobility is impossibly complex, and not well understood by outsiders. It is believed to be a combination of ancestry and merit. The exact title is often worn by the the individual as a piece of jewelry which reflects their **Ledger** entry.

## Mine Titles

Amongst the Dwarves and Gnomes of the Mines, the following titles are recognized, in increasing order of precedence, along with the typical holdings and responsibilities.

- Thane (Clan)
- Jarl (Mine)
- King, Queen (Typically all the Mines on a Continent)

## Urban Titles

The following are the titles recognized in the Urbs, in increasing order of precedence, along with the typical holdings and responsibilities.

- Baron, Baroness (**Barony**, the seat being a Summerday castle)
- Viscount, Viscountess (**Viscounty**, Several Baronies)
- Earl, Countess (**County**, Several Viscounties)
- Marquess, Marchioness (**March**, Several Counties)
- Duke, Duchess (**Duchy**, Several Marches)

As a **March** is the typical roaming area of an Urb, the Marquess or Marchioness is often the titular leader of the Urb. The Duke is often the leader of the Continent.
