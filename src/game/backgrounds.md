# Backgrounds

Players may have a variety of backgrounds. The following is a list of the organizations and groups, along with typical classes and backgrounds. Note that organizations may have other classes and backgrounds, but these are the most common.

## Peerage

Property-owning nobility exist in all Civilizations, and titles are often hereditary. The exact holdings and ancestry are encoded in the **Ledger of the Peerage**, sometimes referred to by Bards as the **Blockchain** for reasons lost to time.
The **Ledger** is a kind of distributed magical artifact that associates the Title of a Holding with the genetic information of the current holder, indeed, the very definition of being a member of the Peerage is someone listed in the **Ledger**.

Each Castela, Mine, and Urb has it's own copy of the **Ledger**, which is an immutable history of all all titles held by all nobles in all cultures on **Mundus**. The records of the **Ledger** stretch backwards in time for thousands of generations, and the vast amount of records in the **Ledger** means that only the largest of Castelas, Mines, and Urbs have the resources to maintain an entire copy of the **Ledger**. Competing claims are often proposed in different copies of the **Ledger**, which is resolved by a kind of magical consensus based upon the number of copies of the **Ledger** that agree with a particular claim. Thus, successful claims are most often registered in the largest Castelas, Mines, and Urbs.

The following are the titles recognized in the Urbs, in increasing order of precedence, along with the typical holdings and responsibilities.

- Baron, Baroness (**Barony**, the seat being a Summerday castle)
- Viscount, Viscountess (Several Baronies)
- Earl, Countess (**County**, Several Viscounties)
- Marquess, Marchioness (**March**, Several Counties)
- Duke, Duchess (**Duchy**, Several Marches)

As a **March** is the typical roaming area of an Urb, the Marquess or Marchioness is often the titular leader of the Urb. The Duke is often the leader of the Continent.

Amongst the Dwarves and Gnomes of the Mines, the following titles are recognized, in increasing order of precedence, along with the typical holdings and responsibilities.

- Thane (Clan)
- Jarl (Mine)
- King, Queen (Typically all the Mines on a Continent)

Elven Nobility is impossibly complex, and not well understood by outsiders. It is believed to be a combination of ancestry and merit. The exact title is often worn by the the individual as a piece of jewelry which reflects their **Ledger** entry.
