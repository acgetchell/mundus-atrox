# Elves

The Elves are a long-lived race that consider themselves the masters of Mundus. There are several species of Elves and they seem to be highly adapted to life wherever they find themselves.

- The *High Elves* commune with the [Fey](fey.md) and live in the [Castelas](castelas.md). Their great Capital sits aloft over the the plateau of *Ovda* in the continent of *Aphrodite*.
They have foldable bat-wings from wrist to ankle with which they can glide great distances, and are immune to acid.

- The Wood Elves live in communities made from the gigantic Sequoias of *Ishtar*. They guard their forests jealously, and like their High Elf cousins, posses gliding membranes. They appear to have lost their immunity to acid,
but are instead resistant to a great many natural toxins.

- The Sea Elves live in [Oceanus](ocean.md) and can breathe underwater. Their wings are thicker and allow them to swim effortlessly. They are not immune to acid, but are resistant to a great many toxins found in Oceanus.

- The Dark Elves live deep underground, and are in constant conflict with their other kin. They do not have wings, but can instead produce spiderwebs. They are resistant to the toxins of the *Underdark*.
