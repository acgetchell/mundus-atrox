# Elves

The Elves are a long-lived race that consider themselves the masters of **Mundus**. There are several species of Elves and they seem to be highly adapted to life wherever they find themselves.

- The *Sky Elves* commune with the [Fey](fey.md) and live in the [Castelas](castelas.md). Their great Capital sits aloft over the continent of **Aphrodite**.
They have foldable bat-wings from wrist to ankle with which they can glide great distances, and are resistant to Acid.

- The *Wood Elves* live in communities made from the gigantic Sequoias of **Ishtar**. They guard their forests jealously, and like their Sky Elf cousins, posses gliding membranes. They appear to have lost their resistance to Acid,
but are instead resistant to a great many natural toxins.

- The [Sea Elves] live in [Oceanus](ocean.md) and can breathe underwater. Their wings are thicker and allow them to swim effortlessly. They are resistant to Cold.

- The [Dark Elves] live deep underground, and are in constant conflict with their other kin. They do not have wings, but can instead produce spiderwebs. They are resistant to the toxins of the **Underdark**.
