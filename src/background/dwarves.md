# Dwarves

Dwarves live in the tunnels surrounding the vast open [Mines](mines.md), which produce metals and other substances for trade with the [Human](humans.md) [Urbs](urbs.md) and [Elven](elves.md) [Castelas](castelas.md).

They dislike Magic and are especially resistant to it.

Their captial city is hidden above the clouds in the high peaks of *Maxwell*.
