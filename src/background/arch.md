# The Arch

> In the earliest days of the world, the vast lands were empty save for two mighty races: the Dragons and the Giants. These colossal beings were in constant competition, each desiring to shape the world in their own image.
>
> The Dragons, graceful and elegant, soared through the skies, painting the heavens with their vibrant flames. Their vision was a world of endless skies and infinite horizons. The Giants, on the other hand, stood tall and mighty, shaping mountains, valleys, and plains with their immense hands. Their dream was a land of towering peaks and deep-rooted forests.
>
> One *Springrise*, a spirited Dragon named *Aeloria* and a wise old Giant named *Grondar* met on **Theia**. They debated fiercely about whose vision for the world was superior. *Aeloria* swooped and darted, her flames casting brilliant colors upon the skies, while *Grondar* stamped his feet, causing tremors that shaped the terrain beneath.
>
> The clash between them was so intense that it threatened to tear the world apart. Fearing for the destruction of what they both cherished, the two stopped and decided to collaborate instead.
>
> *Aeloria* whispered, "What if we combine our strengths and create something **Mundus** has never seen?"
>
> *Grondar* nodded, saying, "Let us craft a symbol of our unity, a bridge between **Mundus** and **Aether**."
>
> Together, they began their work. *Aeloria* breathed motes of fire, her flames soaring high into the sky. *Grondar* reached out with his mighty arms, gathering the swarms and bending them into a magnificent **Arch**, a bridge between the world of the Dragons and the Giants.
>
> The **Arch** became a testament to their collaboration, a symbol that differences can be set aside to create something beautiful. The **Arch** would be a reminder of the unity between the Dragons and the Giants, a bond that would never be broken.
>
> But then came the **Enclouding**, hiding the **Arch** save during *Springrise* and *Autumnset*. And that is another tale.
>
> Still, we few remember when two mighty races set aside their differences to create a masterpiece, teaching us the power of collaboration and unity.
