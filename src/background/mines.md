# Mines

The surface of Mundus is dotted with enormous, open-air mines miles across and many more miles deep.

Gigantic tracks have ground out all flora surrounding these vast pits, and many [Urbs](background/urbs.md) make yearly voyages.

Sometimes these Urbs will winter next to the Mine for mutual protection.
