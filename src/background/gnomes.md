# Gnomes

![Gnome](images/gnome.png)

[Gnomes] often live near the same [Mines](mines.md) as the [Dwarves].

Unlike the [Dwarves], Gnomes have an affinity for magic and are rumored, like the [Elves](elves.md), to be Touched by the [Fey](fey.md).

It is rumored they have their own Capital in *Lada*.
