# The Arclight

**Neverwinter** earns its name from this source of eternal illumination. Regardless of the time or season, the city is always bathed in an artificial yet comforting daylight. The city's residents, working tirelessly within its confines, live in perpetual daytime, giving the city an unusual rhythm and tempo that sets it apart from its counterparts.
