# Castelas

![Castela](images/castela.png)

Artifacts that are vast flying cities of metal which follow the Perpetual Spring.

High Elves can glide the winds, but use Airships to travel long distances.

[Humans](humans.md) and other races can often be found in the Castelas, but almost never in the higher levels reserved for the Nobility.
