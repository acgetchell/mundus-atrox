# Castelas

Artifacts that are vast flying cities of metal which follow the Perpetual Spring.

High Elves can travel short distances by gliding, but use Airships to travel further.

Humans and other races can often be found in the Castelas, but almost never in the higher levels reserved for the Nobility.
