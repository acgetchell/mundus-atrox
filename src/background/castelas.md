[Artifacts](artifacts.md) that are vast flying cities of metal which often follow the [Perpetual Spring](seasons.md).

Sky Elves can glide the winds, but use Airships to travel long distances.

[Humans](humans.md) and other races can often be found in the Castelas, but almost never in the higher levels reserved for the Nobility.
