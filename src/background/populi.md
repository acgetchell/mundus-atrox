# Populi

The land and skies are rife with predators natural and otherwise that, in addition to the hazardous weather, dictates that the *Populi* live in sturdy, defensible, and sometimes mobile [Artifacts](artifacts.md) of unknown design.

The distinction between [Barbaria](barbaria.md) and [Populi](populi.md) is often a matter of debate between *Magi*, but the following are the most commonly accepted members.

- Dragonborn
- Dwarves
- Elves
- Half-Elves
- Half-Orcs
- Halflings
- Humans
- Gnomes
- Otherkin
