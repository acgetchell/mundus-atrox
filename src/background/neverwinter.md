## Description

**Neverwinter** is a formidable [Urb], its silhouette stretching far into the horizon, testament to the ingenuity and resilience of the *Urban League*. A vast metropolis built on eight levels and powered by colossal wheels and caterpillar tracks, it is on the move during *Winternight*, searching for resources and evading the hordes that gather in darkness.

Constructed in ascending tiers, each is an intricate network of streets, factories, warehouses, and residences. The bottom tiers are primarily devoted to resource processing and manufacturing, a hectic maelstrom of machines overseen by the [Artificer]'s Guild, while the upper tiers house the living quarters, businesses, and governmental institutions. In this complex ecology, larger structures devour smaller ones, mimicking the city's overall predatory nature.

The top of **Neverwinter** is dominated by **St. Paul's Cathedral**, a beacon of hope and solace amidst the sometimes grim [Adamantium] and steel. The Cathedral is an architectural marvel, the apex of the city, its spires rising dramatically towards the sky. Its gothic design is a stark contrast to the industrial aesthetic of the city, with ornate stonework and beautiful stained glass windows adding an element of charm.

Atop the cathedral sits the [Arclight], the city's most revered Techno-Magical achievement. This [Artifact] emits soothing light that eradicates Aberrations, Fiends, and Undead while freezing Shapeshifters and casting even magical darkness. The Arclight’s bright halo is more than just a strong defense; it has become an integral part of **Neverwinter’s** identity. The warm, omnipresent light illuminates nearly every corner of the city and is visible from leagues away, a lighthouse guiding lost souls and a constant reminder of the city’s vigilance against the darkness.

Despite its unending hunt for resources and grim necessity of survival, **Neverwinter** remains a beacon of civilization and hope. The [Arclight], its glow reflecting off St. George's Cathedral, is a testament to the [Populi]'s capacity for resilience and innovation amidst the challenging, dystopian reality of the world.

## Layout

The city is organized into levels, each with a distinct purpose and function. Generally speaking, inhabitants do not tend to cross levels, and each level is a self-contained ecosystem. Each level contains structures that are multi-story, and the city is built on a series of wheels and caterpillar tracks that allow it to move. The city is powered by a combination of magic and technology, and the [Artificer]'s Guild is responsible for maintaining the city's infrastructure.
