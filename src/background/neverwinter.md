# Neverwinter

- **Population**: 500,000, predominantly Human
- **Government**: Duke __________, Chancellor of the [Magisterium]
- **Defense**: The *Ten Thousand Crusaders of Light* form a permanent standing army, supplemented by the *Templar* of the [Apostolic See]. The *Armada* is a fleet of Airships and Hippogriff Riders that patrol the skies, supplemented by the *Reserve* of chartered, privately-owned Airships that can be called up on emergency. Members of the [Magisterium] provide supplemental magical support.
- **Commerce**: Agriculture, Magic, Manufacturing, Technology, Trade, Travel
- **Organizations**: The *Arcane Brotherhood*, the *Artificer's Guild*, the *Benedictines*, the *College of Bards*, the *College of Magic*, the *Cult of the Dragon*, the *Harpers*, the *Knights Templar*, the *Order of the Gauntlet*, the *Red Wizards*, the *Urban League*, the *Zhentarim*, and others.

**Neverwinter** is a formidable [Urb], its silhouette stretching far into the horizon, testament to the ingenuity and resilience of the *Urban League*. A vast metropolis built on multiple levels and powered by colossal wheels and caterpillar tracks, it is always on the move, constantly searching for resources and fuel.

Constructed in ascending tiers, each is an intricate network of streets, factories, warehouses, and residences. The bottom tiers are primarily devoted to resource processing and manufacturing, a hectic maelstrom of machines overseen by the [Artificer]'s Guild, while the upper tiers house the living quarters, businesses, and governmental institutions. In this complex ecology, larger structures devour smaller ones, mimicking the city's overall predatory nature.

The top of **Neverwinter** is dominated by **St. Paul's Cathedral**, a beacon of hope and solace amidst the [Adamantium] and steel. The Cathedral is an architectural marvel, the apex of the city, its spires rising dramatically towards the sky. Its gothic design is a stark contrast to the industrial aesthetic of the city, with ornate stonework and beautiful stained glass windows adding an element of charm.

Atop the cathedral sits the [Arclight], the city's most revered techno-magical achievement. This [Artifact] emits a magnificent, continuous stream of light that eradicates the Undead and casts away darkness. The Arclight’s bright halo is more than just a practical solution; it has become an integral part of **Neverwinter’s** identity. The warm, omnipresent light illuminates every corner of the city and is visible from leagues away, a lighthouse guiding lost souls and a constant reminder of the city’s vigilance against the dark.

Despite its unending hunt for resources and grim necessity of survival, **Neverwinter** remains a beacon of civilization and hope. The [Arclight], its glow reflecting off St. George's Cathedral, is a testament to the [Populi]'s capacity for resilience and innovation amidst the challenging, dystopian reality of their world.
