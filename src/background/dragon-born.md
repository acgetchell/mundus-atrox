# Dragonborn

![Dragonborn](images/dragon-born.png)

The [Dragon-born] are a mysterious and sundered people, found living in small conclaves amongst the [Elves](elves.md), [Humans](humans.md), [Dwarves](dwarves.md), and sometimes [Halflings](halflings.md).

Any equipment they have, excepting magic items, must be specially made for their anatomy.

Their relation to the mighty [Dracos](dragons.md) is a matter of much speculation but little knowledge.
