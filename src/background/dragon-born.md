# Dragonborn

The *Draconigena* are a mysterious and sundered people, found living in small conclaves amongst the Elves, Humans, Dwarves, and sometimes Halflings.

They have wings and a thick, powerful tail, and can fly. Any equipment they have, excepting magic items, must be specially made for their anatomy.

Their relation to the mighty [Dracos](dragons.md) is a matter of much speculation but little knowledge.
