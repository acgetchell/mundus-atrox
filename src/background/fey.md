# Fey

![The Wild Hunt](images/wild-hunt.png)

The *Fey* are a group of ancient, powerful, other-worldly **Beings** that left their mark upon the world and races of **Mundus**. Much speculation but little fact surrounds them. Some [Barbaria](barbaria.md) worship them.

Some *Fey* live upon **Mundus**, entering and leaving during *Springrise*.
