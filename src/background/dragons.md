![Dragon Conquering Castle](images/dragon-conquering-castle.png)

The apex predator of the skies are the *Dracos*; huge, intelligent, flying, and enigmatic. They winter in their accustomed lairs and emerge in *Spring*, dining upon the vast herds and other denizens.

*Dracos* covet [Artifacts](artifacts.md) and precious metals, especially gold and platinum, as well as items worked in those metals. Many an [Elf](elves.md), [Dwarf](dwarves.md), or [Gnome](gnomes.md) have successfully bargained for their lives with cunningly wrought jewelry.

They are few in number but terrifying to behold.
