# Dragons

The apex predator of the skies are the *Dracos*; huge, intelligent, flying, and enigmatic. They winter in their accustomed lairs and emerge in *Spring*, dining upon the vast herds and other denizens.

*Dracos* covet *Artifacts* and precious metals, especially gold and platinum, as well as items worked in those metals. Many an Elf, Dwarf, or Gnome have successfully bargained for their lives with cunningly wrought jewelry.

They are few in number but terrifying to behold.
