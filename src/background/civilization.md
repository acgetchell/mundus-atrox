# Civilization

Civilization on **Mundus** is situated in the [Dwarven](../background/dwarves.md) [Mines](mines.md), [Human](../background/humans.md) [Urbs](urbs.md), and [Elven](../background/elves.md) [Castelas](castelas.md).

The [Halfling](../background/halflings.md) communities and Wood Elven forests are also considered as part of the Civilized world, although they are extremely difficult to find even with an explicit invitation.
