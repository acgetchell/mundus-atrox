# Urbs

Gigantic roving cities of metal, the Urbs ingest great quantities of ore and other substances, often from [Mines](mines.md), which they can manufacture into [Artifacts](artifacts.md).

These manufacturing processes seem intrinsic to the *Urb* itself; the *Artificers Guild* seem mainly to ensure continued functionality of the machinery.

Some whisper the *Artificers* themselves have little understanding themselves of the inner workings of the Urbs, but such rumors are firmly put down by the *Protectors* of the *Magisterium*.

Urbs range in size from merely gigantic rovers to mile-long structures with as many as seven tiers. The typical Urb moves at walking pace, and the clanking of their gigantic treads can be heard for miles.

Some say the inhabitants of the Urbs have a near-permanent deafend condition.
