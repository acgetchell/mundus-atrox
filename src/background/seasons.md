# Sky and Seasons

![The Arch](images/arch.jpeg)

The day and night cycle on **Mundus** is tied to the seasons.

*Springrise* is when the **Sun** rises in the West. It lasts for about 24 hours, during which time the paths to **The Feywild** are open. The skies clear of *Winternight's* clouds and the brilliance of the **Arch** can be most clearly seen. 

During *Summerday* the **Sun** rises high in the sky, circling the horizon but never setting, bringing forth the great mists from the Ocean that is the *Enclouding*. The nearly constant daytime overcast lasts for ~1400 hours,
and the climate is hot and steamy. The flora and fauna go into overdrive, making the most of *Summerday* before the next *Winternight*.

With *Autumnset* the **Sun** sets in the West and the *Enclouding* dissipates. Also lasting 24 hours, the skies again show the **Arch**, and the paths to **The Shadowfell** open.

*Winternight* is the long darkness, with lots of snowfall and, when the clouds dissipate, the **Arch** spans from horizon to horizon, causing perpetual twilight. Most animals migrate or hibernate, and the Undead emerge.

The *Arch* is thickest in the higher latitudes of *Ishtar*, although reports of distant traders say it is thin in the skies of *Aphrodite*.
The *Vigils* are a grouping of bright stars which move across the night sky in intricate patterns.

The [High Elves](elves.md) say **Mundus** is a giant sphere, and their [Castelas](castelas.md) follow the *Perpetual Spring*, the narrow band between the *Daylight* and the *Darkness* that circles the world yearly.
