# Population

The peoples of *Mundus* are often categorized by *Magi* as *Barbaria* and *Populi*.

[Barbaria](barbaria.md) live a nomad existence, following (and sometimes tending) the vast herds which provide sustenance and shelter.

[Populi](populi.md) live in fixed shelters (e.g. the great *Mines*) or roving techno-magical constructions (*Urbs* and *Castelas*).
