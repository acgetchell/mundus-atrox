# Geography

![Volcano image](images/snowy-volcanos.jpg)

The majority of terrain is flat plains with crinkle ridges and basaltic rock, weathered by sudden and common flash floods (in *Summerday*) and avalanches of snow (in *Winternight*).
Mountain ranges are jagged, marked by broken escarpments, sharp caldera, and intense winds that can strip flesh from bone.

There are three known continents:

- **Ishtar** is the northermost and most hospitable
- **Aphrodite** is the larger and more dangerous, straddling the equator
- **Lada** is the unexplored southern continent

Countless islands lie between.

There are large chains of volcanoes throughout **Mundus**. The tallest volcano is **Maxwell** in **Ishtar**, but the largest is **Theia** in **Aphrodite**. These shield volcanos are hundreds of miles across, and the lands are criss-crossed with lava tubes and vents, making overland travel across (and even over) dangerous.

There are few large permanent rivers on each continent, which often change their course during the *Summerday* snow-melts.
