<p><em>Springrise</em> is when the <strong>Sun</strong> rises in the West. It lasts for about 24 hours, during which time the paths to <strong>The Feywild</strong> are open. The skies clear of <em>Winternight's</em> clouds and the brilliance of the <strong><a href="background/arch.html">Arch</a></strong> can be most clearly seen.</p>
<p>During <em>Summerday</em> the <strong>Sun</strong> rises high in the sky, circling the horizon but never setting, bringing forth the great mists from the Ocean that is the <strong>Enclouding</strong>. The nearly constant daytime overcast lasts for ~1400 hours,
and the climate is hot and steamy. The flora and fauna go into overdrive, making the most of <em>Summerday</em> before the next <em>Winternight</em>.</p>
<p>With <em>Autumnset</em> the <strong>Sun</strong> sets in the West and the <strong>Enclouding</strong> dissipates. Also lasting 24 hours, the skies again show the <strong><a href="background/arch.html">Arch</a></strong>, and the paths to <strong>The Shadowfell</strong> open.</p>
<p><em>Winternight</em> is the long darkness, with lots of snowfall and, when the clouds dissipate, the <strong>Arch</strong> spans from horizon to horizon, causing perpetual twilight. Most animals migrate or hibernate, and the Undead emerge.</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="background/arch.html">Arch</a></strong> is thickest in the higher latitudes of <strong>Ishtar</strong>, although reports of distant traders say it is thin in the skies of <strong>Aphrodite</strong>.
The <strong>Vigils</strong> are a grouping of bright stars which move across the night sky in intricate patterns.</p>
<p>The <a href="background/elves.html">Sky Elves</a> say <strong>Mundus</strong> is a giant sphere, and their <a href="background/castelas.html">Castelas</a> follow the <em>Perpetual Spring</em>, the narrow band of <em>Springrise</em> between <em>Summerday</em> and <em>Winternight</em>
which they say circles the world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the earliest seasons of the world, the vast lands were empty save for two mighty races: the Dragons and the Giants. These colossal beings were in constant competition, each desiring to shape the world in their own image.</p>
<p>The Dragons, graceful and elegant, soared through the skies, painting the heavens with their vibrant flames. Their vision was a world of endless skies and infinite horizons. The Giants, on the other hand, stood tall and mighty, shaping mountains, valleys, and plains with their immense hands. Their dream was a land of towering peaks and deep-rooted forests.</p>
<p>One <em>Springrise</em>, a spirited Dragon named <em>Aeloria</em> and a wise old Giant named <em>Grondar</em> met on <strong>Theia</strong>. They debated fiercely about whose vision for the world was superior. <em>Aeloria</em> swooped and darted, her flames casting brilliant colors upon the skies, while <em>Grondar</em> stamped his feet, causing tremors that shaped the terrain beneath.</p>
<p>The clash between them was so intense that it threatened to tear the world apart. Fearing for the destruction of what they both cherished, the two stopped and decided to collaborate instead.</p>
<p><em>Aeloria</em> whispered, &quot;What if we combine our strengths and create something <strong>Mundus</strong> has never seen?&quot;</p>
<p><em>Grondar</em> nodded, saying, &quot;Let us craft a symbol of our unity, a bridge between <strong>Mundus</strong> and <strong>Aether</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>Together, they began their work. <em>Aeloria</em> breathed motes of fire, her flames soaring high into the sky. <em>Grondar</em> reached out with his mighty arms, gathering the swarms and bending them into a magnificent <strong>Arch</strong>, a bridge between the world of the Dragons and the Giants.</p>
<p>The <strong>Arch</strong> became a testament to their collaboration, a symbol that differences can be set aside to create something beautiful. The <strong>Arch</strong> would be a reminder of the unity between the Dragons and the Giants, a bond that would never be broken.</p>
<p>But then came the <strong>Enclouding</strong>, hiding the <strong>Arch</strong> save during <em>Springrise</em> and <em>Autumnset</em>. And that is another tale.</p>
<p>Still, we few remember when two mighty races set aside their differences to create a masterpiece, teaching us the power of collaboration and unity.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="geography"><a class="header" href="#geography">Geography</a></h1>
<p><img src="background/images/snowy-volcanos.jpg" alt="Volcano image" /></p>
<p>The majority of terrain is flat plains with crinkle ridges and basaltic rock, weathered by sudden and common flash floods (in <em>Summerday</em>) and avalanches of snow (in <em>Winternight</em>).
Mountain ranges are jagged, marked by broken escarpments, sharp caldera, and intense winds that can strip flesh from bone.</p>
<p>There are three known continents:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ishtar</strong> is the northermost and most hospitable</li>
<li><strong>Aphrodite</strong> is the larger and more dangerous, straddling the equator</li>
<li><strong>Lada</strong> is the unexplored southern continent</li>
</ul>
<p>Countless islands lie between.</p>
<p>There are large chains of volcanoes throughout <strong>Mundus</strong>. The tallest volcano is <strong>Maxwell</strong> in <strong>Ishtar</strong>, but the largest is <strong>Theia</strong> in <strong>Aphrodite</strong>. These shield volcanos are hundreds of miles across, and the lands are criss-crossed with lava tubes and vents, making overland travel across (and even over) dangerous.</p>
<p>There are few large permanent rivers on each continent, which often change their course during the <em>Summerday</em> snow-melts.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="oceanography"><a class="header" href="#oceanography">Oceanography</a></h1>
<p><img src="background/images/ahstat.jpg" alt="World image" /></p>
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD053 -->
<p><em>Oceanum</em> spans the entire world. Although the winds are mild at sea level compared to the tempests at altitude, they gather force for thousands of miles, and along with the tremendous ocean-crossing waves, make sailing upon the surface a hazardous affair. The skies above <em>Oceanum</em> are often no better, with great turbulent masses of clouds tossing even the largest <em>Castela</em> about. The only regular travelers across <em>Oceanus</em> are the mysterious <em>Submersible Urbs</em>, such as <strong>Waterdeep</strong>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="climate"><a class="header" href="#climate">Climate</a></h1>
<p><img src="background/images/winternight.png" alt="Winternight" /></p>
<p>The air is thicker, and the climate is hot and wet during <em>Summerday</em>, and cold and wet at <em>Winternight</em>.</p>
<p><em>Autumnset</em> and <em>Springrise</em> are the most temperate, pleasant climes.</p>
<p>Winds are gentle to non-existent in the plains, increasingly stronger with higher altitudes. When the air smells rotten, becomes extremely dry, and turns greenish-yellow, almost everything finds shelter from the <em>Acid Rains</em>.</p>
<p>Weather by season can be generated from <a href="https://donjon.bin.sh/d20/weather/">Donjon's Random Weather Generator</a>.</p>

<p><img src="background/images/dall-e-rex-v-knight.png" alt="Predator-vs-knight" /></p>
<p>There is a tremendous variety of flora and fauna. Land animals tend towards gigantism, and <em>Oceanus</em> contains vast denizens in its mysterious depths. Tremendous flocks of avian and other creatures stretch for miles and continuously wheel about the skies, often unseen through the <strong>Enclouding</strong> but discerned by the tremendous racket of their calls. Plants and Animals both have strange and mysterious abilities, and are often harvested or hunted for their magic.</p>
<p>The jungles of <strong>Ishtar</strong> resemble the Pacific Northwest, with giant colonies of Sequoias that grow on the plateaus and mountain slopes. The jungles of <strong>Aphrodite</strong> have quintuple canopies of rubbery and flexible plants which die or go dormant during Autumnset
and Winternight, only to grow again during Springrise and Summerday.</p>

<p>The apex predator of the skies are the <em>Dracos</em>; huge, intelligent, flying, and enigmatic. They winter in their accustomed lairs and emerge during <em>Springrise</em>, dining upon the vast herds and other denizens.</p>
<p><em>Dracos</em> covet <a href="background/artifacts.html">Artifacts</a> and precious metals, especially gold and platinum, as well as items worked in those metals. Many an <a href="background/elves.html">Elf</a>, <a href="background/dwarves.html">Dwarf</a>, or <a href="background/gnomes.html">Gnome</a> have successfully bargained for their lives with cunningly wrought jewelry.</p>

<p>The <em>Old Ones</em> are a group of utterly inimical <strong>Beings</strong> that seem to have little relationship to the natural order of things.</p>
<p>Near them, the laws of Nature and Magic become warped and hostile to anything nearby, which are often twisted to accommodate this <em>outre</em> existence.</p>
<p>They often enter or leave <strong>Mundus</strong> during <em>Autumnset</em>, when paths to <strong>The Shadowfell</strong> lie open.</p>

<p>The Elves are a long-lived race that consider themselves the masters of <strong>Mundus</strong>. There are several species of Elves and they seem to be highly adapted to life wherever they find themselves.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <em>Sky Elves</em> commune with the <a href="background/fey.html">Fey</a> and live in the <a href="background/castelas.html">Castelas</a>. Their great Capital sits aloft over the continent of <strong>Aphrodite</strong>.
They have foldable bat-wings from wrist to ankle with which they can glide great distances, and are resistant to Acid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>Wood Elves</em> live in communities made from the gigantic Sequoias of <strong>Ishtar</strong>. They guard their forests jealously, and like their Sky Elf cousins, posses gliding membranes. They appear to have lost their resistance to Acid,
but are instead resistant to a great many natural toxins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/1026400-sea-elf">Sea Elves</a> live in <a href="background/ocean.html">Oceanus</a> and can breathe underwater. Their wings are thicker and allow them to swim effortlessly. They are resistant to Cold.

<li>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/3-elf#DarkElf(Drow)">Dark Elves</a> live deep underground, and are in constant conflict with their other kin. They do not have wings, but can instead produce spiderwebs. They are resistant to the toxins of the <strong>Underdark</strong>.

<h2 id="description"><a class="header" href="#description">Description</a></h2>
<p><strong>Neverwinter</strong> is a formidable <a href="background/urbs.html">Urb</a>, its silhouette stretching far into the horizon, testament to the ingenuity and resilience of the <em>Urban League</em>. A vast metropolis built on eight levels and powered by colossal wheels and caterpillar tracks, it is on the move during <em>Winternight</em>, searching for resources and evading the hordes that gather in darkness.</p>
<p>Constructed in ascending tiers, each is an intricate network of streets, factories, warehouses, and residences. The bottom tiers are primarily devoted to resource processing and manufacturing, a hectic maelstrom of machines overseen by the <a href="background/../game/artificer.html">Artificer</a>'s Guild, while the upper tiers house the living quarters, businesses, and governmental institutions. In this complex ecology, larger structures devour smaller ones, mimicking the city's overall predatory nature.</p>
<p>The top of <strong>Neverwinter</strong> is dominated by <strong>St. Paul's Cathedral</strong>, a beacon of hope and solace amidst the sometimes grim <a href="background/../game/magic-items.html#adamantium">Adamantium</a> and steel. The Cathedral is an architectural marvel, the apex of the city, its spires rising dramatically towards the sky. Its gothic design is a stark contrast to the industrial aesthetic of the city, with ornate stonework and beautiful stained glass windows adding an element of charm.</p>
<p>Atop the cathedral sits the <a href="background/arclight.html">Arclight</a>, the city's most revered Techno-Magical achievement. This <a href="background/artifacts.html">Artifact</a> emits soothing light that eradicates Aberrations, Fiends, and Undead while freezing Shapeshifters and casting even magical darkness. The Arclight’s bright halo is more than just a strong defense; it has become an integral part of <strong>Neverwinter’s</strong> identity. The warm, omnipresent light illuminates nearly every corner of the city and is visible from leagues away, a lighthouse guiding lost souls and a constant reminder of the city’s vigilance against the darkness.</p>
<p>Despite its unending hunt for resources and grim necessity of survival, <strong>Neverwinter</strong> remains a beacon of civilization and hope. The <a href="background/arclight.html">Arclight</a>, its glow reflecting off St. George's Cathedral, is a testament to the <a href="background/populi.html">Populi</a>'s capacity for resilience and innovation amidst the challenging, dystopian reality of the world.</p>
<h2 id="government"><a class="header" href="#government">Government</a></h2>
<p><strong>Neverwinter</strong> is governed by the <em>House of Lords</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Lords Temporal</em>, 13 <a href="background/../game/peerage.html">Peer</a>s who are appointed by and include the ranking <a href="background/../game/peerage.html">Peer</a> <em>Marchioness Lyanna Alagondar</em>.</li>

<p>The city is organized into levels, each with a distinct purpose and function. Generally speaking, inhabitants do not tend to cross levels, and each level is a self-contained ecosystem. Each level contains structures that are multi-story, and the city is built on a series of wheels and caterpillar tracks that allow it to move. The city is powered by a combination of magic and technology, and the <a href="background/../game/artificer.html">Artificer</a>'s Guild is responsible for maintaining the city's infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>Neverwinter</strong> earns its name from this source of eternal illumination. Regardless of the time or season, the city is always bathed in an artificial yet comforting daylight. The city's residents, working tirelessly within its confines, live in perpetual daytime, giving the city an unusual rhythm and tempo that sets it apart from its counterparts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Amidst the rolling hills of green,<br />
Where ancient mysteries lie unseen,<br />
Stands a circle of stones so grand,<br />
A monument of an unknown hand.</p>
<p>Stonehenge, they call it, a wonder of old,<br />
A place where stories and legends unfold,<br />
Whispers of magic, of gods and kings,<br />
Of druids, and rituals, and sacred things.</p>
<p>In the hours of Springrise, a new life begins,<br />
As nature awakens from her winterly sins,<br />
And Stonehenge, too, seems to come alive,<br />
As if a resurrection of times gone by.</p>
<p>The sun rises high, and the air is crisp,<br />
The stones stand tall, as if in a mystic tryst,<br />
The morning dew glistens on the green,<br />
As if a sign of a sacred dream.</p>
<p>Amidst this magic, a sense of hope,<br />
Of new beginnings, a way to cope,<br />
As if the stones themselves proclaim,<br />
The promise of life, the end of the game.</p>
<p>So, on this cycle of resurrection and spring,<br />
Let us gather at Stonehenge and sing,<br />
Songs of joy, of hope, and of love,<br />
And let the stones bless us from above.</p>

language that sounds like <em>Common</em> but is full of outlandish words with little meaning to outsiders. <em>Artificers' Guild</em> members can recognize
each other via this <em>Artificers' Cant</em>.</p>
<p>As <em>Artificers</em> are present in all centers of
<a href="game/../background/civilization.html">Civilization</a>, they are highly valued and protected by the <em>Artificers' Guild</em> (as
long as they are members of good standing). Naturally, the <em>Artificers' Guild</em> frowns upon non-Guild practicioners, but such folk are in demand
and do quite well trading or living amongst the <a href="game/../background/barbaria.html">Barbaria</a>.</p>
<h2 id="hit-points"><a class="header" href="#hit-points">Hit Points</a></h2>
<p><em>Hit Dice</em>: 1d8 per Artificer level</p>
<p><em>Hit Points at 1st Level</em>: 8 + Constitution modifier</p>
<p><em>Hit Points at Higher Levels</em>: 1d8 (or 5) + Constitution modifier per level after 1st</p>
<h2 id="proficiencies"><a class="header" href="#proficiencies">Proficiencies</a></h2>
<p><em>Armor</em>: Light armor, medium armor, shields</p>
<p><em>Weapons</em>: Simple weapons, <a href="game/firearms.html">Firearms</a></p>
<p><em>Tools</em>: Thieves' Tools, Tinkers' Tools, one type of Artisans' Tools</p>
<p><em>Saving Throws</em>: Intelligence, Constitution</p>
<p><em>Skills</em>: Choose two from <em>Arcana</em>, <em>History</em>, <em>Investigation</em>, <em>Medicine</em>, <em>Nature</em>, <em>Perception</em>, <em>Sleight of Hand</em></p>
<h2 id="spellcasting"><a class="header" href="#spellcasting">Spellcasting</a></h2>
<p>Spells &quot;cast&quot; by an <em>Artificer</em> involve wonders and outlandish inventions, and either <em>Thieves' Tools</em> or <em>Artisans' Tools</em> are always
required as a <em>Material</em> component to the spell. Once <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe/artificer#InfuseItem">Infuse Item</a> is attained at 2nd level, any item bearing an <em>Infusion</em> may be used
as a spellcasting focus.</p>
<p>Intelligence is used as the <em>Artificers</em> spellcasting ability.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="apostolic-see-1"><a class="header" href="#apostolic-see-1">Apostolic See</a></h1>
<p>The Apostolic See is the formal religion of the Urbs, based upon the worship of the Holy Trinity. The Apostolic See is a hierarchical organization, composed of Clerics (Clergy) and non-Clerics (Laity). The hierarchy is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presbyter (Cleric)
<ul>
<li>Deacon (Laity)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bishop (Cleric)
<ul>
<li>Archdeacon (Laity)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Archbishop (Cleric)
<ul>
<li>Vicar (Laity)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cardinal (Cleric)
<ul>
<li>Legate (Laity)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each <strong>Cathedral</strong> is led by a Presbyter and governed by a Deacon. Cathedrals within a geographic area are grouped into a <strong>Diocese</strong>, which are led by a Bishop and governed by an Archdeacon. <strong>Dioceses</strong> are grouped into ecclesiastical <strong>Provinces</strong>,
under the leadership of the Bishop of a particular <strong>Diocese</strong>, which is called the <strong>Metropolitan</strong> or Archdiocese. The Bishop of the Metropolitan is an Archbishop, and the Archdiocese is governed by the Vicar. The Metropolitans gather every so often
to elect a Cardinal, who is the spiritual leader of the Apostolic See. The Cardinal then appoints a Legate as the secular leader of the Apostolic See.</p>
<p>In addition to the Clergy and Laity, the Apostolic See has several other organizations.</p>
<h2 id="benedictine-order"><a class="header" href="#benedictine-order">Benedictine Order</a></h2>
<p>Although formally part of the Apostolic See, they are otherwise independent, with each congregation led by an Abbot. The Benedictine Order is dedicated to the preservation of knowledge, and they tend to the
<a href="game/peerage.html#ledger">Ledger of the Peerage</a> nearest their Cloister. The Benedictine Order known to have Bards in its ranks.</p>
<h2 id="dominican-order"><a class="header" href="#dominican-order">Dominican Order</a></h2>
<p>The Dominicans are an order of mendicant Monks best described as the intelligence organization of the Apostolic See. Although they have Abbeys led by Abbots, they are rumored to answer to a Legate.</p>
<h2 id="franciscan-order"><a class="header" href="#franciscan-order">Franciscan Order</a></h2>
<p>The Franciscans are an order of mendicant Clerics and Monks best described as the humanitarian organization of the Apostolic See. Novices and Initiates go to Dominican Abbeys for training; once completed, Franciscan Monks are itinerant.</p>
<h2 id="jesuit-order"><a class="header" href="#jesuit-order">Jesuit Order</a></h2>
<p>The Jesuits are an order of Clerics, Monks, and Fighters best described as the academic and military organization of the Apostolic See. The Jesuit Order is led by the Superior General, with the headquarters of the society, the <strong>General Curia</strong>, in <strong><a href="game/../background/neverwinter.html">Neverwinter</a></strong>. They otherwise have no formal ranks, although in practice most Jesuits rank by seniority.</p>
<h2 id="the-inquisition"><a class="header" href="#the-inquisition">The Inquisition</a></h2>
<p>The Inquisition is a group dedicated to the protection of the Apostolic See from heresy and corruption. The Inquisition is led by the Grand Inquisitor, who is also a Legate. The Inquisition is typically composed of Dominicans and Franciscans.</p>
<h2 id="templar"><a class="header" href="#templar">Templar</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>Templar</strong> are a military Order of Clerics and Paladins, dedicated to the protection of the Apostolic See from supernatural threats. The <strong>Templar</strong> are led by the Grand Master, and are further divided into the Knights <strong>Templar</strong>, who are always members of the Peerage, and non-Peerage Paladins and Clerics. The basic unit is the Tredectet, a group of 12 <strong>Templar</strong> led by a Knight Templar. The membership and rank structure is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brother/Sister (War Domain Cleric)</li>
<li>Paladin
<ul>
<li>Squire</li>
<li>Corporal</li>
<li>Sergeant</li>
<li>Master Sergeant</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Knight Templar (Paladin)
<ul>
<li>Squire</li>
<li>Sir/Dame</li>
<li>Lord/Lady Commander (Leader of a Tredectet)</li>
<li>Master</li>
<li>Grand Master of the Templar</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="magisterium-1"><a class="header" href="#magisterium-1">Magisterium</a></h1>
<p>The Magisterium is a group of Sorcerers and Wizards who are dedicated to the study of magic. Each Urb has a <strong>Campus</strong> led by a Chancellor, with <a href="game/../background/neverwinter.html">Neverwinter</a> being among the most prestigious.</p>
<p>As with the <a href="game/../game/peerage.html">Peerage</a>, magical rankings are encoded in the <strong>Ledger of the Magisterium</strong>, copies of which are kept in <strong>Campus</strong> libraries.</p>
<p>Ranks of within the Magisterium are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initiate</li>
<li>Adept</li>
<li>Baccalaureate</li>
<li>Magister</li>
<li>Doctorate</li>
<li>Distinguished Doctorate</li>
<li>Provost</li>
<li>Chancellor</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="peerage-1"><a class="header" href="#peerage-1">Peerage</a></h1>
<p>Property-owning nobility exist in all Civilizations, and titles are often hereditary. The exact holdings and ancestry are encoded in the <strong>Ledger of the Peerage</strong>, sometimes referred to by the Benedictines as the <strong>Blockchain</strong> for reasons lost to time.
The <strong>Ledger</strong> is a kind of distributed magical artifact that associates the Title of a Holding with the genetic information of the current holder, indeed, the very definition of being a member of the Peerage is someone listed in the <strong>Ledger</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="ledger"><a class="header" href="#ledger">Ledger</a></h2>
<p>Each Castela, Mine, and Urb has it's own copy of the <strong>Ledger</strong>, which is an immutable history of all titles held by all nobles in all cultures on <strong>Mundus</strong>. The records of the <strong>Ledger</strong> stretch backwards in time for thousands of generations, and the vast amount of records in the <strong>Ledger</strong> means that only the largest Castelas, Mines, and Urbs have the resources to maintain an entire copy of the <strong>Ledger</strong>. Competing claims are often proposed in different copies of the <strong>Ledger</strong>, which is resolved by a kind of magical consensus based upon the number of copies of the <strong>Ledger</strong> that agree with a particular claim. Thus, successful claims are most often registered in the largest copies.</p>
<h2 id="castelan-titles"><a class="header" href="#castelan-titles">Castelan Titles</a></h2>
<p>Elven Nobility is impossibly complex, and not well understood by outsiders. It is believed to be a combination of ancestry and merit. The exact title is often worn by the the individual as a piece of jewelry which reflects their <strong>Ledger</strong> entry.</p>
<h2 id="mine-titles"><a class="header" href="#mine-titles">Mine Titles</a></h2>
<p>Amongst the Dwarves and Gnomes of the Mines, the following titles are recognized, in increasing order of precedence, along with the typical holdings and responsibilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thane (Clan)</li>
<li>Jarl (Mine)</li>
<li>King, Queen (Typically all the Mines on a Continent)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="urban-titles"><a class="header" href="#urban-titles">Urban Titles</a></h2>
<p>The following are the titles recognized in the Urbs, in increasing order of precedence, along with the typical holdings and responsibilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Baron, Baroness (<strong>Barony</strong>, the seat being a Summerday castle)</li>
<li>Viscount, Viscountess (<strong>Viscounty</strong>, Several Baronies)</li>
<li>Earl, Countess (<strong>County</strong>, Several Viscounties)</li>
<li>Marquess, Marchioness (<strong>March</strong>, Several Counties)</li>
<li>Duke, Duchess (<strong>Duchy</strong>, Several Marches)</li>
</ul>
<p>As a <strong>March</strong> is the typical roaming area of an Urb, the Marquess or Marchioness is often the titular leader of the Urb. The Duke is often the leader of the Continent.</p>

<p>A <em>Pistol</em> or <em>Musket</em> discharges one lead ball per barrel.</p>
<p>Shotguns discharge a number of pellets per barrel.</p>
<p>The <em>Quattour</em> and <em>Sept</em> may discharge all barrels in a single round. In this instance, the firer receives <em>Disadvantage</em> unless they possess

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="spellcasting-1"><a class="header" href="#spellcasting-1">Spellcasting</a></h1>
<p>To cast a spell, a character requires three things:</p>
<h2 id="spell-knowledge-and-preparation"><a class="header" href="#spell-knowledge-and-preparation">Spell Knowledge and Preparation</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/rogue#ArcaneTrickster">Arcane Tricksters</a>, <a href="game/artificer.html">Artificers</a>, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/bard">Bards</a>, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/fighter#EldritchKnight">Eldritch Knights</a>, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/ranger">Rangers</a>, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/sorcerer">Sorcerers</a>, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/warlock">Warlocks</a>, and <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/wizard">Wizards</a> must know and/or prepare spell formula
to cast spells.</p>
<p>These formulae take different forms, depending upon the discipline of the spell-caster, and usually do not translate across classes.</p>
<p><em>Example: the spell formula for Magic Missile written by <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/wizard">Wizards</a> is different from the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/sorcerer">Sorcerers</a> Magic Missile.</em></p>
<p>Some classes, like the <a href="game/artificer.html">Artificer</a>, can change known spells by tinkering with their spellcasting focus. Other classes, like <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/wizard">Wizards</a>, write down formulae in their spellbooks. The number of known spells can exceed the number of prepared spells.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/rogue#ArcaneTrickster">Arcane Tricksters</a> and <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/wizard">Wizards</a> must prepare spells from their list of known spells. For all other classes, there is no distinction
between known spells and prepared spells.</p>
<p><strong>Only prepared spells can be cast.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric">Clerics</a>, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/druid">Druids</a>, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/sorcerer">Sorcerers</a>, and <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/wizard">Wizards</a> can prepare a number of spells equal to their Spellcasting Attribute bonus + class level.</p>
<p><em>Example: A 5th-level Wizard with an Intelligence of 16 can prepare 8 spells.</em></p>
<p><a href="game/artificer.html">Artificers</a> and <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/paladin">Paladins</a> can prepare a number of spells equal to their Spellcasting Attribute bonus + half their class level, rounded down.</p>
<p><em>Example: A 3rd-level Paladin with a Charisma of 17 can prepare 4 spells.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/rogue#ArcaneTrickster">Arcane Tricksters</a>, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/bard">Bards</a>, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/fighter#EldritchKnight">Eldritch Knights</a>, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/ranger">Rangers</a>, and <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/warlock">Warlocks</a> have a fixed number of prepared spells depending on their level.</p>
<p><em>Example: A 5th-level Warlock can prepare 6 spells, regardless of Charisma.</em></p>
<h2 id="spell-level"><a class="header" href="#spell-level">Spell Level</a></h2>
<p><strong>Second, the character must be able to channel magical ability of that level.</strong></p>
<p><em>Example: a 5th-level Wizard can channel up to 3rd-level spells.</em></p>
<h2 id="mana"><a class="header" href="#mana">Mana</a></h2>
<p><strong>Lastly, the character must have available <a href="game/mana.html">Mana</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Using <a href="game/mana.html">Mana</a> often requires <em>Verbal</em>, <em>Somatic</em>, and/or <em>Material</em> components, which are consumed when <a href="game/mana.html">Mana</a> is expended.
If these words, gestures, or materials are interrupted or interfered with, the spell fizzles and the <a href="game/mana.html">Mana</a> is lost.</p>
<h2 id="environmental-effects"><a class="header" href="#environmental-effects">Environmental Effects</a></h2>
<p>Spells which use an <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#AttackRolls">Attack Roll</a> normally generate <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#CriticalHits">Critical Hits</a> on a roll of 20.</p>
<p><em>Example: Call Lightning does not trigger <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#CriticalHits">Critical Hits</a>, because it has a Saving Throw.</em></p>
<p>Certain spells have enhanced effects in certain environments, as follows:</p>
<p>A spell with a <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#DamageTypes">damage type</a> matching the environment generates a Critical Hit on a 19 or 20 <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#AttackRolls">Attack Roll</a>.
Likewise, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#SavingThrows">Saving Throws</a> are at Disadvantage.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mana-1"><a class="header" href="#mana-1">Mana</a></h1>
<p><em>Mana</em>, regardless of provenance, powers magic, and spellcasters use it to cast spells.</p>
<p>To determine how much <em>Mana</em> is available, for each <em>Spell Slot</em> multiply by <em>Spell Level</em> and add up the total. This is summarized in the tables below.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Example: a 4th level Wizard has 10 Mana (4 1st-level slots x 1 + 3 2nd-level slots x 2 = 10).</em></p>
<p>Spells cost <em>Mana</em> equal to their level, plus any modifiers to that level.</p>
<p><em>Example: Fireball (a 3rd-level spell) cast at 5th-level with an additional 2d6 damage (10d6 total) costs 5 Mana.</em></p>
<p><em>Cantrips</em> and other <em>At Will</em> abilities do not consume <em>Mana</em> directly, as they are innate to the <strong>Being</strong>.
Certain classes also have spells that are <em>Always Prepared</em> and which do not count against Spell Slots.
In this case, <em>Always Prepared</em> spells are added to both the <em>Known Spells</em> list and the <em>Prepared Spells</em> list,
and their <em>Spell Levels</em> are added to the <em>Mana</em> for the character.</p>
<p><em>Example: A 5th level Druid in the Circle of the Forest has 26 Mana. Barkskin, Spider Climb, Call Lightning, and Plant Growth are always
prepared and may be cast if the Druid has sufficient Mana.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/customization-options#RitualCaster">Ritual Spells</a> require <em>Mana</em> equal to their level available to begin the ritual, but the spellcaster attunes the spell to the <em>Mana</em> of the environment.
Thus, it does not deplete the spellcaster's <em>Mana</em> directly.</p>
<p><em>Example: Identify requires, but does not use, 1 Mana to start the ritual.</em></p>

<p><em>Springrise</em> casts its rays over the <strong>Sword Coast</strong> as <strong><a href="journals/../background/neverwinter.html">Neverwinter</a></strong> makes its way along the <strong>High Road</strong> to spend <em>Summerday</em> at <strong>Biscayne Bay</strong>, awaiting the arrival of <strong>Waterdeep</strong>, the largest known Submersible Urb.</p>
<p>The <em>Magisterium</em> declares <em>Springrise</em> as the majority of the inhabitants of <strong><a href="journals/../background/neverwinter.html">Neverwinter</a></strong> exchange their musty and clamorous dwellings for the
warmth of the surrounding lands. Gaily colored tents and trade booths dot the surrounding countryside, patrolled by the <em>Crusaders</em> astride their
clanking beasts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Dwarf named <em>Gundren Rockseeker</em> asks you to bring a wagon-load of provisions to the Summerday settlement of <strong>Phandalin</strong>, 20 hours travel Southwest of your current location.
<em>Gundren</em> was clearly excited and more than a little secretive about his reasons for the trip, saying only that he and his brothers had found &quot;something big&quot;, and that he'd pay you
ten gold pieces each to escort his supplies to <strong>Barthen's Provisions</strong>, a trading post in <strong>Phandalin</strong>.
He then set out ahead of you on horse, along with a warrior escort named <em>Sildar Hallwinter</em>, claiming he needed to arrive early to &quot;take care of business&quot;.
You've spent the last 8 hours following the broad <strong>High Road</strong> South, and you've just recently veered east along the <strong>Triboar Trail</strong>. You've encountered no trouble so far, but the wilderness is always dangerous and full of predators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Character introductions were made.</p>
<p>The party encountered two dead horses along the trail. Despite <em>Geral</em>'s warning, the party went to investigate and were ambushed by Goblins.</p>
<p><em>Geral</em> leapt forward to save <em>CoralKing</em>, <em>Benjamin</em>, and <em>Wulrif</em> and <em>Orky</em>'s charge broke the back of Goblin resistance.</p>
<p>The remainder disengaged and slunk back into the woods, firing desultory arrows at <em>Orky</em> to no effect.</p>
<p><em>Benjamin</em> determined the Goblins to have numbered a dozen, and they dragged someone away. Empty satchels and a map case were found near the dead horses.</p>
<h4 id="300-xps"><a class="header" href="#300-xps">300 XPs</a></h4>
<p>A further 8 hours travel along the <strong>Triboar Trail</strong>, and <em>Benjamin</em> discovered a Goblin lair in a cave hidden in the woods a scant two bowshots from the trail.
Concealed in natural surroundings, <em>Benjamin</em> observed the Goblins taking a bound human into the cave. From there, any other travelers along the <strong>Triboar Trail</strong> are sure to come under assault.</p>
<p>The party crept to the cave entrance, leaving <em>Geral</em> and <em>Tysnera</em> to guard the oxen team and wagon full of the provisions they were hired to deliver.</p>
<p>The party ambushed two guards at the cave entrance, and then slew three wolves just inside the cave in a filthy den.</p>
<p>Before they could go further, <em>Tysnera</em> arrived bearing the news that the wagon caravan was under attack by a foul beast.</p>
<p>Returning, the party encountered an Owlbear, which had dispatched <em>Geral</em> and was ravaging the remains of the oxen team.</p>
<p>The Owlbear was defeated and <em>Geral</em> revived from near death. The remains of four oxen were scattered amongst the beast's feeding frenzy, and <em>Benjamin</em> eventually retrieved the remaining four.</p>
<p>The party must decide what to do next.</p>

<p><img src="journals/images/goblin.png" alt="Goblins" /></p>
<p>After determining that the Goblins in the cave were going to be a persistent threat until taken care of,
the party decided to hide the wagon and oxen in a safe place and go back to the cave. <em>Benjamin</em> found
a good location off the main trail for the oxen, and <em>Wulrif</em> cast an illusion over the wagon to hide it,
with limited success.</p>
<p>The group set off toward the caves, only to be met by a party of a dozen Goblins attempting to ambush them again.
The team succeeded in defeating the Goblin raiding party, with a few Goblins escaping back into the woods.
<em>CoralKing</em> detected and the party avoided two traps along the trail the Goblins had set, and the party found themselves
back at the mouth of the cave.</p>
<p>Proceeding cautiously, the party noted the chamber that had formerly held the wolves to contain little more than bloodstains.
Careful investigation revealed a narrow chimney 20' or so up in the chamber, but the climb looked slick and difficult and
no one risked it. Moving deeper into the cave, it again branched, going upwards into a large chamber with a wooden bridge 20'
over the stream flowing down the left side of the main cave tunnel. A side branch also went upwards, but the ceiling was much
lower. While the party was deciding what to do, a huge deluge of water came roaring down the main passage, washing away most of the party.
A few desultory arrows came out of the darkness, but they had little effect.</p>
<p>The group decided to explore instead the side passage, but this time they made use of the pickaxes and ropes that many of them had been
carrying. CoralKing stealthily crept up the passage, finding another group of 6 Goblins arguing and abusing a tied up human.</p>
<p>Turning the tides, the group blitzed into the room, taking down all of the Goblins except one, which they kept as a prisoner.</p>
<p>The human prisoner turned out to be <em>Sildar Hallwinter</em>, a retired warrior and bodyguard of <em>Gundren Rockseeker</em>. He relayed that they
were both ambushed by a large band of Goblins with a Bugbear leader, who took <em>Gundren</em> someplace else.</p>
<p>The party turned to interrogate the captured Goblin, who revealed a number of items:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bugbear's name is <em>Klarg</em>, and he's the leader of the band, which numbers more than two dozen. But <em>Yeemik</em> is second in command, and know's many things of interest to the group.</li>
<li><em>Klarg</em> answers to <em>King Grol</em>, chief of the <em>Cragmaw tribe</em>, who dwells in <strong>Cragmaw Castle</strong>.</li>
<li><em>Klarg</em> received a messenger from <em>King Grol</em> a few cycles ago. Someone named <em>The Black Spider</em> was paying the <em>Cragmaws</em> to watch for the Dwarf
<em>Gundren Rockseeker</em>, capture him, and send him and his effects (but most especially a map) back to <em>King Grol</em>.</li>
<li><em>Klarg</em> took <em>Gundren</em> to <strong>Cragmaw Castle</strong>. <em>Yeemik</em> can lead the party there.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point <em>Sildar</em> interrupts, saying he needs to get to <strong>Phandalin</strong> along with the supplies, because he needs to find out the whereabouts of
his friend, <em>Iarno Glasstaff</em>, who went to <strong>Phandalin</strong> last Summerday to prepare the way. He offers an additional 50 gold pieces for safe escort to <strong>Phandalin</strong>.</p>
<p>The party agrees that they need to get <em>Sildar</em> and the wagon of supplies to <strong>Phandalin</strong>, and then find <em>Gundren</em>.</p>
<p>Turning south along the <strong>Triboar Trail</strong>, the party, along with <em>Sildar</em> and <em>Yeemik</em>, head towards <strong>Phandalin</strong>.</p>
<p>They pass another wagon that has been torn apart, bodies littered everywhere. As they approach, the bodies rise with a groan and attack.</p>
<p>These strange Undead puff blinding clouds of ash when hit. Worse, they seem resistant to swords, arrows, and even <em>Calmul</em>'s breath weapon.
They likewise take no notice of charms or enchantments, but <em>Orky</em> has success with her mace, <em>CoralKing</em> with his headbutts, and <em>Geral</em> with a
makeshift club. <em>Actias</em> and <em>Wulrif</em>'s spells likewise affect the monsters. <em>Benjamin</em>, <em>Steve</em>, and <em>Skolg</em>,
equipped with only slashing and piercing weapons, guard <em>Yeemik</em> to ensure he doesn't run off in the Confusion.
<em>Sildar</em> yells out that these are &quot;Ash Zombies&quot;.</p>
<p>The Ash Zombies go down very hard, but eventually they do go down.</p>
<p>The party stops to rest and recuperate.</p>

<p>The party finally makes it to <strong>Phandalin</strong>. <em>Sildar</em> leads the group to the <strong>Stonehill Inn</strong>, where they set about procuring lodgings. <em>Sildar</em> pays the
party the 50 gold pieces and sets off in search of his friend, <em>Iarno Glasstaff</em>.</p>
<p>The group then drops off the supplies to <strong>Barthen's Provisions</strong>, where they get paid and briefly chat with <em>Barthen</em>.</p>
<p><em>Yeemik</em> the Goblin is causing a bit of a stir, so they head to the <strong>Townmaster's Hall</strong> next, where they encounter <em>Harbin Wester</em> and his group of <em>Dwarven Mercenaries</em>.
<em>Harbin</em> offers them the use of the jail in the basement, and after a few tense moments with the Dwarves <em>CoralKing</em> decides
to stay with <em>Yeemik</em> to ensure no shenanigans.</p>
<p><em>Harbin</em> offers a bounty of 100gp if the party will clear out the Orcs harassing travelers on the <strong>Triboar Trail</strong> to the East.
The group considers it. <em>Geral</em> asks where a healer might be found and <em>Harbin</em> replies that someone occasionally tends the <strong>Shrine of Luck</strong>.</p>
<p>No one is at the <strong>Shrine of Luck</strong>, so <em>Tasbros</em> and <em>Tysnera</em> decide to do their meditations there while the rest of the party rests at the <strong>Stonehill Inn</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Tysnera</em> and <em>Tasbros</em> encounter the returning <em>Sister Garaele</em>, injured and the worse for wear. <em>Sister Garaele</em> is looking for <em>Bojangle's Spellbook</em>,
and the last entity that might know it's location is <em>Agatha the Banshee</em>, who haunts the ruins of <strong>Conyberry</strong>. She offers three potions of healing plus
her services upon their return, and says that if <em>Agatha</em> is approached correctly, she may be amenable to answering questions.
<em>Sister Garaele</em> offers a silver comb as a gift for <em>Agatha</em>.</p>
<p>After conferring and restocking provisions, the group sets off on the <strong>Triboar Trail</strong>, intending to speak to <em>Agatha</em> and clear out the Orcs.</p>
<p>Making camp, they are beset by a pack of 8 vicious Allosaurs!</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/allosaurs.jpeg" alt="Allosaurs Attack!" /></p>
<p>The Allosaurs blitz the party, jumping and shredding with claws and teeth. The party spellcasters scramble up trees for cover,
and <em>Orky</em>, <em>Geral</em>, and <em>CoralKing</em> hold the center.  <em>Actias</em> and <em>Wulrif</em> cast potent curses and <em>Eldritch Blasts</em>, <em>Calmul</em> breathes
poison and provides critical blessings to <em>Orky</em>, and <em>Geral</em> makes a couple of key saves with his shield as well as inspiring <em>Orky</em>
to heroic feats with her now-flaming Great Sword. <em>Steve</em> and <em>Benjamin</em> shoot arrows and <em>Viker</em> saves the life of the unfortunate <em>Tysnera</em> who has
been taken into the jaws of an Allosaur after she and <em>Tasbros</em> expended all of their potent combat spells.</p>
<p>Triumphant after an epic battle, the party heals up and considers their next action.</p>

</ul>
<p>In the aftermath of the battle with the pack of Allosaurs, the party camped between the tread marks of a passing <em>Urb</em> on the <strong>Triboar Trail</strong>, reasoning the deep indentations
and broken ground would provide a more defensible camp site. While resting they saw a curious sight: strange, whirring clockwork automatons marching single file out of the
forest over to the bodies of the Allosaurs. Ignoring the party entirely, the strange machines proceeded to render the bodies into small pieces.</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/clockwork-horror.png" alt="Clockwork Horror" /></p>
<p>The sights and sounds were unpleasant to say the least, so the party moved a bit further along the trail of the Urb. The rest period was otherwise uneventful, the light
from the <strong>Enclouding</strong> giving a dreamlike quality while everyone meditated and healed.</p>
<p>Midway through the next 8-hour march, the <em>Urban</em> trail turns North into the forest, a vast scar of sawn-down trees and torn-up earth rent between the giant Sequoias.</p>
<p>The group continues East, reaching the ruins of <strong>Conyberry</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The forest grows dark and still as the trail winds deeper into the trees. Heavy vines and thick layers of moss drape the branches,
and the air is noticeably colder than it was in the ruined village. Rounding a bend in the trail, you see a screen made from the warped
branches of trees standing close together, woven into a domelike shelter in the shadows. A low doorway leads inside.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The adventurers enter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The air grows cold, and a powerful feeling of dread grips you. A cold, pale light flickers in the air, rapidly taking on the form of a
female Elf, her hair and robes waving in a spectral wind. She might have been beautiful once, but a hateful expression twists her features now.
“Foolish mortals,” she snarls. “What do you want here? Do you not know it is death to seek me out?”</p>
<p>&quot;We have brought you a gift,&quot; replies <em>Wulrif</em>. He offers her <em>Garaele's</em> <em>Silver Comb</em>.</p>
<p>The ghostly figure smiles with cold amusement. “Very well,” she says. “I know that you seek many things. Ask me one question, and I will give you an answer.”</p>
<p>&quot;Where is Bojangle's spellbook?&quot; asks <em>Wulrif</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;I traded that to a Necromancer named <em>Tsernoth</em> from <strong>Iriaebor</strong>, let's see, more than a hundred years ago. I do not know what happened to it after that.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Agatha</em> disappears.</p>
<p>After some consultation, the party decides to head South to look at the <strong>Old Owl Well</strong>, a point of interest on the map. The ground gets steeper and the wind picks up.</p>
<p>They encounter an old Dwarf riding a horseless carriage.</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/dwarf-horseless-carriage.png" alt="Dwarf and his horseless carriage" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Hallooooo!&quot; he yells, seemingly friendly.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello&quot;, replies <em>Orky</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After establishing that he is a Miner around these parts, the party asks a few questions.</p>
<p>On the strange mechanical scavengers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Oh, avoid the Clockwork Horrors if you can.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what do they want?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No one knows, but best not to get in their way if you can help it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's <strong>Old Owl Well</strong>?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, an ancient tower. Be careful, there's Undead been spotted around there.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a few more shouts the party continues, finally making camp on a hillside as the wind picks up.</p>
<p>And that's when the Orc war-band attacks!</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/orcs-attacking-downhill.png" alt="Orcs attack!" /></p>
<p>The party isn't surprised, but the Orcs have the high ground and the wind makes archery difficult.</p>
<p>There are ten Orcs, with a fearsome War-Chief and, as it becomes apparent, a Shaman. The Shaman casts buffs on the attacking group
which rushes downhill at the party. <em>Geral</em>, <em>Orky</em>, and <em>CoralKing</em> move to block.</p>
<p><em>Benjamin</em> and <em>Steve</em> shoot arrows with limited success. The unusual resistance of the Orcs to
<em>Hexes</em> and such from <em>Wulrif</em> and <em>Actias</em> indicates that the Shaman has countered some of their spells. <em>Tasbros</em> and <em>Tysnera</em> get in some
damaging spell strikes. But it is the center that is held by <em>Geral</em>, <em>Orky</em>, and <em>CoralKing</em>, who absorb the brunt of the warband's attacks.</p>
<p><em>CoralKing</em> goes down no less than three times, revived by <em>Viker</em> and <em>Calmul</em> before finally falling. His stand gives
<em>Orky</em> and <em>Geral</em> time to deal with the Shaman and the other Orcs, until only the War-Chief is left. The War-Chief's death strike is a mighty blow
which nearly takes <em>Geral</em> with him.</p>
<p><em>Viker</em> heals <em>CoralKing</em> just before he takes the long dirt nap to join his ancestors.</p>
<p>Battered, the party rests, taking suitable trophies from the Orcs.</p>
<p>Again, two Clockwork Horrors arrive and the party leaves them to their grisly task. During the Long Rest, <em>Benjamin</em>
sees three leave.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you crest a low ridge, you spy the crumbling ruins of an old watchtower standing amid the rugged hills.
The place is so old that the walls are only mounds of rubble enclosing a courtyard of sorts, adjacent to the broken stump of an old tower.
A colorful tent has been set up in the middle of the courtyard, but no one is in sight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Actias</em> casts <em>Invisibility</em> on <em>Steve</em>, who stealthily reconnoiters.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, a quite visible <em>Steve</em> walks stiffly back, in some sort of magical grip by a bald, tattooed, red-robed Mage. Twelve <em>Zombies</em>
lurk nearby, but do not attack.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot; asks the Mage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Wulrif</em> seems to be the de-facto spokesperson of the group.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We were looking for the <strong>Old Owl Well</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed, you have found it.&quot; An odd gleam in his eyes. &quot;Have you spoken to <em>Agatha</em>?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have a question of her I would bade you ask, and a gift to offer.&quot; A strange metal box floats over.</p>
<p>&quot;What is inside the box?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Probably best you don't know,&quot; says the Mage with a chilling smile. &quot;I can offer you this ring as a reward.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Viker</em> goes into a brief trance, then nods and whispers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;It's a Ring of Protection.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The party consults briefly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We accept.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Steve</em> the Halfling walks over of his own accord, unharmed.</p>
<p>The party treks back down the foothills, surprisingly not encountering anything unusual. Another four hours travel brings them to <em>Agatha's</em> lair.</p>
<p>A wave of cold, and <em>Agatha</em> looks at the party, curiously.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We have a gift, and a question.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Agatha</em> gestures and the curiously heavy metal box floats over, lid opening.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Acceptable. What is your question?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is the name of the tower at <strong>Old Owl Well</strong>?</p>
<p><em>Agatha</em> seems to think a moment. &quot;The <strong>Tower of Endymion</strong>.&quot; She vanishes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Back to <strong>Old Owl Well</strong>. The Mage receives the answer with interest, and delivers the ring.
After consultation, the party decides that <em>CoralKing</em> shall be it's bearer.</p>
<p>But the next rest period brings a strange clicking sound, and the appearance of three Clockwork Horrors. Ignoring the rest of the party, they make a beeline for <em>CoralKing</em>.</p>
<p>The things have mechanical saws and pincers, and return fire with <em>Lightning Bolts</em> when <em>Benjamin</em> hits them, harmlessly, with
his arrows. No weapon the party has seems to have the least effect on them. <em>CoralKing</em> struggles, but is astonishingly quickly subdued.
They cut off the ring (and <em>CoralKing's</em> finger), then retreat back the way they came. <em>Actias</em> sends an <em>Eldritch Blast</em> at them, narrowly dodging
return <em>Lightning Bolts</em>.</p>
<p>The party looks at each other haplessly, then go to heal <em>CoralKing</em>.</p>

<li><em>Wulrif</em>, a 4th-level Human Warlock</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Viker</em> revives <em>CoralKing</em>, who immediately wants to get his ring back (the <strong>Precious</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Benjamin</em> uses <em>Primeval Awareness</em> to try to track the Clockwork Horrors, but they are something beyond his understanding.
He does sense a Dragon flying North of the party just before it moves out of range.</p>
<p><em>Tasbros</em> thinks the Clockwork Horrors are some kind of Construct, and <em>Calmul</em> agrees.</p>
<p>The great tracks of the <em>Urb</em> once again provides shelter as the party marches for two rest periods back to <strong>Phandalin</strong>.
They greet <em>Sister Garaele</em> at the <strong>Shrine of Luck</strong> and relay <em>Agatha's</em> answer.
<em>Sister Garaele</em> is grateful and offers her healing and more potions.
She can't regenerate <em>CoralKing's</em> finger, but <em>Qelline Alderleaf</em>, a local farmer, might know a Druid who can.</p>
<p>The group heads back to the <strong>Townmaster's Hall</strong>, where they meet <em>Harbin Wester</em>, and retrieve the Goblin from the gaol.
<em>Geral</em> makes the Goblin swear allegiance as his armor bearer, and names him <em>Snaga</em>. The party gives <em>Harbin</em> the Orc tusks, for which he pays 5gp per pair, 50gp total.
<em>Calmul</em> and <em>Geral</em> spot the firearms carried by <em>Harbin's</em> Dwarven mercenaries, and note that they don't seem to protect anyone else in the town.
Harbin talks about the <em>Redbrand Ruffians</em>, who recently arrived and began beating up and killing townfolk.</p>
<h4 id="300-xps-1"><a class="header" href="#300-xps-1">300 XPs</a></h4>
<p><img src="journals/images/phandalin.jpg" alt="Phandalin" /></p>
<p>The party heads to the <strong>Phandalin Miner's Exchange</strong>, meeting the proprietor, <em>Halla Thorton</em>. A shrewd, sharp-looking human woman, she tells them more about the <em>Redbrands</em>,
and offers 100gp for the death of their leader, an unknown Mage who recently arrived. <em>Wulrif</em> senses an ulterior motive, though.
<em>Halla</em> notes that many <em>Redbrands</em> hang out at the <strong>Sleeping Giant Inn</strong>, and but their leader is almost always at <strong>Tresendar Manor</strong>. <em>Halla</em> thinks there might be two dozen <em>Redbrands</em>.</p>
<p>The party carefully reconnoiters the manor, preparing to set a trap near the <strong>Sleeping Giant Inn</strong>. By chance, four <em>Redbrands</em> emerge from the <strong>Sleeping Giant Inn</strong>, triggering the ambush.</p>
<p>It's any easy fight for the party, and the <em>Redbrands</em> are quickly overwhelmed. A <em>Redbrand</em> is captured and interrogated, and the party discovers that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The leader of the <em>Redbrands</em> is a Human Wizard known as <em>Glasstaff</em>. Arcana knowledge by <em>Tysnera</em> notes that is likely a <em>Staff of Defense</em>.</li>
<li>Someone called the <em>Black Spider</em> hired the <em>Redbrands</em> to frighten off adventurers and intimidate the locals. The <em>Black Spider</em> sent Bugbears to reinforce the <em>Redbrands</em>.</li>
<li>Underneath the manor lives a hideous &quot;eye monster&quot;, which the <em>Redbrands</em> avoid.</li>
<li>The <em>Redbrands</em> have captive townsfolk &quot;near the old crypt&quot;, guarded by Skeletons.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Benjamin</em> uses <em>Primeval Awareness</em> again to discern that there is some sort of Aberration underneath the manor, as well as a large group of Undead.</p>
<p>The party returns to the <strong>Phandalin Miner's Exchange</strong>, deciding to pass on assaulting <strong>Tresendar Manor</strong>. <em>Wulrif</em> discerns that <em>Halla</em> is interested in taking over the <em>Redbrands</em>.</p>
<p>They encounter <em>Sildar Hallwinter</em>, who seems to be the new Townmaster.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What happened to Harbin, you ask? As soon as he saw me, that fool scurried off with his guards back to his Bank. Good riddance, I say!
He didn't have the fortitude to do what needs to be done around here. But how goes the search for <em>Gundren</em>? Have you found <strong>Cragmaw Castle</strong>?
I'll pay you 500gp for the rescue of <em>Gundren Rockseeker</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The party finds this more appealing.</p>
<p><em>Snaga</em> indeed knows some crafty pathways which, after a full 8 hours march, lead the party to <strong>Cragmaw Castle</strong> without notable encounters.</p>
<p>The party scouts cautiously.</p>
<p><em>Viker</em> shapeshifts into a field mouse and hops into <em>Steve's</em> pocket. <em>Actias</em> turns <em>Steve</em> (and <em>Viker</em>) invisible.
<em>Benjamin</em> follows stealthily as the three of them take up station by the front entrance to the West.</p>
<p>The rest of the party carefully moves to the Southern entrance, beneath the arrow slits.
<em>Calmul</em> produces small, scurrying spider Constructs which <em>Infuse</em> <em>Orky's</em> Chain Mail and Greatsword with Magic.</p>
<p><em>Actias</em> uses <em>Mold Earth</em> to collapse the South Wall, exposing the Goblins inside!</p>

<p><em>Gundren</em> is so happy to see us! He wants to return to <strong>Phandalin</strong> and then take us along to <strong>Wave Echo Cave</strong>.
<em>Gundren</em> was in <em>King Grol’s</em> chamber and grabs his map. <em>Steve</em> finds 3 healing potions, 220 sp, and 160 electrum hidden under a filthy mattress.
<em>King Grol</em> had black armor and a black sword, which Calmul says is made of <a href="journals/../game/magic-items.html#adamantium">Adamantium</a>.
<em>Gundren</em> recognizes the sword and armor as <em>Sildar</em>’s, who he says will probably want it back. For the time being, I take the chain mail and <em>Viker</em> takes the sword.</p>
<p>There is a large beast trapped in the castle. <em>Benjamin</em> wants to open the door. I do not!
<em>Benjamin</em> starts digging and we see a paw digging from the other side! Its head comes out and we see that it’s an Owl Bear.
Now it’s completely out, sees us, meanders over, and starts snacking on the remains of a Goblin. A few of us go to explore the room it came from.
We move 30 ft toward a different corridor and attempt to go around the Owl Bear, which starts growling at us. <em>Steve</em> tries to sneak around the Owl Bear, but
his Stealth roll fails. So, he uses Luck but fails again. He is forced to step carefully back and move through another corridor. The Owl Bear stops growling and turns back to it's Goblin.
We follow <em>Steve</em>. We can still hear growling and shuffling but it gets fainter. <em>Viker</em>, who is waiting outside the castle, sees the Owl Bear run off.
I stay back to keep distance, everyone else enters the room.</p>
<p>The room is a silo that extends far up into darkness. <em>Benjamin</em> and <em>CoralKing</em> see a jagged ledge that used to be a second floor.
Back from the ledge, nearly hidden, is a chest. <em>Benjamin</em> manages to get up to that ledge. <em>Steve</em> climbs up a rope that <em>Benjamin</em> throws down.
<em>Steve</em> uses a crow bar to pry the chest open. It has coins, 2 scrolls, and a potion bottle.
<em>Steve</em> takes the coins (120 gp and 90 electrum). He gives <em>Benjamin</em> a scroll and <em>Viker</em> the other scroll, along with the potion.
<em>Viker</em> can identify the scrolls.</p>
<p><em>Steve</em> takes a cursory look around and sees that there’s not much left in the rest of the castle. As we join <em>Viker</em> we hear a weird crashing sound in the forest.
<em>Viker</em> identifies the potion as healing and the scrolls are Silence and Revivify. Since we found the 3 healing potions with <em>Gundren</em>, we now have 4.
We also now hear a clicking sound like the ones the automatons made when they chop up a body.
<em>Viker</em> and <em>Benjamin</em> go to investigate the sound. They find a clearing with 2 Stegosaurs, one on the ground.
The automatons are trying to reach it, but the other Stegosaur is whipping around with its tail, defending it.
We can also see a clutch of eggs by the fallen Stegosaur.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <em>Steve</em>, <em>CoralKing</em>, and I are hearing the noises. The automatons turn toward us like they might attack. So, well, we roll Initiative:</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/clockwork-horror.png" alt="Clockwork Horrors" /></p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> uses Hunter’s Sense. They are Constructs, vulnerable to Acid. They are immune to Lightning, Poison, Cold, Fire, Radiant, and attacks from Piercing/Slashing non-magical weapons. We find all this out later, <em>Benjamin</em> only has time to shout out &quot;Use magical weapons!&quot;.</li>
<li>I approach the closest Construct and swing my Infused Greatsword, missing.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> uses her new Longsword and hits, doing 5 damage.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> hides.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> attacks the other Construct with an unarmed strike and a bonus strike. He hits with one and deals 7 damage.</li>
<li>A Construct attacks me and hits. It deals 9 points of damage after 3 attacks. A second one Lightning Bolts <em>CoralKing</em> with (luckily) 4 points of damage. The 3rd one attacks the Stegosaur and hits all 3, one critically. It deals a lot of damage. The Stegosaur staggers but attacks back. Because its tail spikes are mostly piercing, it deals little damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 2</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> tries to communicate to the Stegosaur that we are going to help them. He attacks a Construct with his Quarterstaff, missing.</li>
<li>I attack again and do 8 damage. (18 to hit)</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> uses her Spirit Totem (Bear) as a Bonus action, giving everyone 9 temporary hit points. She swings her sword and hits, dealing 8 damage.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> makes an unarmed strike and misses.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> makes an unarmed strike and crits, dealing double damage (7).</li>
<li>I get messed up by the Constructs and do 20 damage in return. <em>Viker</em> gets hit once and takes 3 damage. The 3rd one attacks the Stegosaur.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 3</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> misses.</li>
<li>I Disengage and moves behind the Construct to flank it with <em>Viker</em> and gain Advantage. Then, I cast Searing Smite as a Bonus action (extra 1d6 fire damage + my enemy must take a constitution save)</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> misses her attacks.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> hits the Construct critically and does 3 damage.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> hits one headbutt and does 5 damage.</li>
<li>The Constructs hit <em>CoralKing</em> 1/6 times with their flanked advantage on him, lucky! He gets 9 points of damage. I get bit for 7 points of damage. One of the Constructs shoots 2 bolts of Lightning at another damaged Construct and heals it 34 HP! The Stegosaur attacks and does 15 damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 4</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> moves and heals me for 9 HP while a Construct gets an Opportunity attack on him but misses.</li>
<li>I hit and deal 22 damage! However, the extra flames don't seem to have an effect.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> disengages and moves to the 3rd Construct (it is the most damaged since it keeps getting hit by the Stegosaur) to cast a Shillelagh cantrip as a Bonus action which gives her wooden staff magical damage.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> hits a Construct with an Unarmed attack and does 2 points of damage.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> uses Step of the Wind (which disengages from the 2nd Construct as a Bonus action) to move and flank the 1st Construct with me and attack. He hits and does 8 damage.</li>
<li>The 2nd Construct moves closer to me and attacks. They hit twice and deal 10 points of damage but only 4 stick. Remember that every hit is reduced by 3 because of my armor and feat!
A critical hit is also done by the 1st Construct and does 22 points of damage, 19 sticks. The 3rd one attacks <em>Viker</em> and does 7 points of damage. The Stegosaur flanks and hits a Construct for double damage! That Construct is down!</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 5</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> heals me for 9 points!</li>
<li>I swing on the 1st Construct, do 14 damage, and it goes down! So, a fully healed Construct is still up.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> hits the 2nd construct (the one remaining) and deals 3 damage.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> hits the Construct and does 2 damage.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> moves closer to the remaining Construct using his Flurry of Blows and hits once. He does 5 damage.</li>
<li>The 2nd Construct shoots bolts of lighting at its companions, healing the 1st one and reviving the 3rd one. They seem to act in perfect coordination. The Stegosaur knocks the 3rd one over again.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 6</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> heals the downed Stegosaur for 12 points.</li>
<li>I hit with the Greatsword and do 14 damage to the 1st Construct.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> hits it so the Construct is back down.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> misses a dagger throw.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> does 11 damage to the remaining Construct with a Flurry of Blows!</li>
<li>The Construct heals his friend 13 and the other 17. The Stegosaur hits with advantage and drops one. The other Stegosaurus gets up, moves, and misses a whack on the 1st Construct.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 7</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> misses but is now flanking the Construct.</li>
<li>I hit the 17 HP Construct and do 15 damage.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> hits the damaged Construct and knocks it over again. She also hands <em>Steve</em> her Longsword while keeping her Shillelagh.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> swings on the 1st Construct with the Longsword and lands a critical hit for 19 damage! We should have given him the Longsword sooner!</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> uses his Flurry of Shin-kicks with 1 hit and 1 crit for 15 damage.</li>
<li>1 Construct gets 21 HP and the other one gets 14 HP. The Stegosaur hits the 21 for 15 damage. The other Stegosaur swings and misses.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 8</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> misses a swing with his staff.</li>
<li>I knock the one on 5HP down.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> drops a Construct.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> moves to the Construct with 14 HP and misses a swing.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> flanks the last Construct and uses his Flurry of attacks. He hits once, deals 7 damage, and it drops! As it falls apart, the magic ring and a black, decayed finger fall out of it!!!</li>
</ol>
<p>The Stegosaurs turn toward us, not knowing if they need to defend themselves against us. We back off, slowly. <em>Benjamin</em> and <em>Viker</em> speak soothingly. It turns out the female was the one up defending
while her mate had taken a lot of Lightning bolts. We leave the Druid and the Ranger to communicate with them.</p>
<p>The Constructs have a single large, jeweled eye in the center of their face, and are made of <a href="journals/../game/magic-items.html#adamantium">Adamantium</a>. As we remove the eyes we can see the life fade from them. We all gather up as much of their material as we can and stuff it into our backpacks. We go back to our group at the castle and take a long rest.</p>

<p>The group decides to search the castle, starting with the Southwest corner. We find some Shortbow arrows and ragged bedrolls that stink. In a large room we find many weapons (Morning stars, Long swords), including a finely-wrought Quarterstaff.
<em>Actias</em> picks it up and it's lighter than it looks. We determine that it’s a +1 Quarterstaff, so we give it to <em>Actias</em>.</p>
<p>In the large main suite we find a property deed. It names <em>Magus Arnin</em> as the owner and seems to be written on brand new, faintly magical, parchment. The deed is registered in <strong><a href="journals/../background/neverwinter.html">Neverwinter</a></strong>.
<em>Geral</em> rolls it up and takes it with us.</p>
<p><em>Wulrif</em> and others investigate the remaining rooms. In one, <em>Tasbros</em> finds an old brazier. <em>Steve</em> pokes at the pile of coal underneath it, and <em>Wulrif</em> uses Mage Hand to rummage through it. There's a bloody cloth wrapped around a golden statue
of an Elf with his wings outstretched. We detect Divination magic on it. <em>Wulrif</em> tells everyone else not to touch it, but <em>Actias</em> has already grabbed it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is your question?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Actias</em> hurriedly shoves the statuette into his backpack.</p>
<p>We investigate the center most Northern room.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This chamber occupies the northern tower of the castle. A stone altar stands in the middle of the room, covered with bloodstained black cloth. Golden ritual implements—a chalice, a knife, and a censer—are carefully arranged on top of the altar.
Two archways to the south are covered with heavy curtains.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Wulrif</em> uses his Mage Hand to put them in his bag. I sense great evil in this room, but neither <em>Benjamin</em> nor I detect any Undead. <em>Wulrif</em> investigates the altar further and doesn’t find anything.
<em>CoralKing</em> produces the surprising insight that the altar isn’t magic <em>per se</em>, but the traumatic events that took place there left an aura.</p>
<h4 id="300-xp"><a class="header" href="#300-xp">300 XP</a></h4>
<p>We all have a long rest.</p>
<p>Our plan is to go back to <strong>Phandalin</strong> to return <em>Gundren</em>, maybe head to <strong>Tresendar Manor</strong>, and then proceed to <strong><a href="journals/../background/neverwinter.html">Neverwinter</a></strong> to claim the ruined castle.</p>
<p>On our way back, a young Green Dragon swoops down on us from behind, ambushing us with it's Poisonous breath weapon, doing 26 damage to everyone who succeeds their saving throws!
For those who didn’t, <em>Actias</em> and I, we take 52 damage and get knocked down. The Dragon swoops around for a second pass ...</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/young-green-dragon-swooping.png" alt="Young Green Dragon Swooping" /></p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<p>We decide to scatter since we are in the middle of the plains between <strong>Neverwinter Wood</strong> and the <strong>Triboar Trail</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> runs away and shoots his Longbow, but misses. He hits with his second shot and does 10 damage.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> moves 25 feet in the opposite direction and shoots his Shortbow, hitting for 6 damage. He also hides, strategically. The Dragon needs a 22 to spot him.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> runs towards <em>Benjamin</em> and holds his action until the Dragon is within range.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> critically fails his death saving throw.</li>
<li>The Dragon swoops in and attacks <em>Tasbros</em>, luckily missing with a bite and claw attack, doing 9 HP damage with the other claw. It breathes in deeply ...</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> summons her Unicorn spirit totem and casts Cure Wounds on <em>Actias</em>, bringing him back from the brink of death with 12 HP of healing; everyone else is healed 5 HP.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> communicates with the Dragon in its native language:</li>
</ol>
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 -->
<blockquote>
<p>Please! I have so much to learn from you!</p>
<p>Faugh! I'm merely snacking on a few Half ....</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="8">
<li>We have 4 Elves (<em>Viker</em>, <em>Tasbros</em>, <em>Tysnera</em>, <em>Benjamin</em>), and I'm HalfElven. <em>Calmul</em> next attempts to be intimidating and fails.</li>
<li>I'm prone, so I get up and use Misty Step (2 Mana) to Teleport behind a tree.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> attempts to barter with the Dragon, but it's not interested.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> shoots the Dragon once and uses Commander's Strike on <em>Benjamin</em>. <em>Geral</em> hits and deals 4 damage. <em>Benjamin</em> also hits and deals 18 damage!</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> casts Lightning Bolt (8d6 damage!!!) and deals 26 damage! I peek out from behind my tree and silently cheer!</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> casts Chromatic Orb and deals the Dragon 13 damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 2</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> shoots his Longbow twice and hits for 18 damage. The Dragon is starting to get very mad at <em>Benjamin</em>.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> stealthily shoots the Dragon with his bow and rolls a critical hit on a Sneak Attack for 29 damage!</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> throws his javelin at the Dragon and hits for 10 HP of damage.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> turns <em>Tysnera</em> invisible and runs away.</li>
<li>The Dragon puts on a burst of speed and flies 160 ft away!!!</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> heals me for 17 HP and everyone else 5.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> is beside himself.</li>
<li>I walk towards it and Command the Dragon to halt. It ignores me.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> pursues the Dragon, attempting to hit it with Eldritch Blast and failing.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> gives <em>Actias</em> 4 temporary hit points.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> stays invisible and recovers.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> chases the Dragon and casts Fireball. The Dragon just barely escapes the direct blast, taking 16 damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 3</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> pursues and shoots his bow, dealing 11 damage.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> shoots and misses.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> recovers his javelin.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> pursues with Eldritch Blast and misses.</li>
<li>The Dragon flies out of range, trailing smoke.</li>

<p>We all take a short rest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We have a problem,&quot; says Viker.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We all look back and see that <em>Gundren</em> (and <em>Snaga</em>) are dead. <em>Gundren</em> was supposed to lead us to <strong>Wave Echo Cave</strong>. <em>Viker</em> has a Scroll of Revivify and asks if we want to use it on him. We all begrudgingly agree, so <em>Viker</em> works on that for 10 minutes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Gundren</em> wakes up. &quot;What happened?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You lost&quot;, replies <em>Wulrif</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you for saving my life, &quot; says <em>Gundren</em>, bowing. &quot;We Dwarves always repay our debts. When we find my brothers in <strong>Wave Echo Cave</strong> and restart <strong>Phandelver Mine</strong>, you shall have 10% of the proceeds.</p>
<p>&quot;Sounds good to us&quot;, replies <em>Geral</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Phandalin</strong> seems oddly deserted ...</p>
<p>There are a couple of Dwarven mercenaries outside of the bank, but otherwise no one is in sight. <em>Gundren</em> wants to go to the <strong>Townmaster's Hall</strong> to greet <em>Sildar</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You have rescued my old friend&quot;, says <em>Sildar</em>. &quot;I will pay you the reward we agreed to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We also have your armor and sword&quot;, says <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed? That is most welcome news! The sword is an heirloom of my family, but I think that a fellow Crusader might make better use of the armor than I ...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What happened to the townsfolk?&quot;, I ask.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, well, the <em>Redbrands</em> have been carrying off the folk to slavery, I fear. Held in the basement of <strong>Tresendar Manor</strong> until they conclude their foul business with the Hobgoblins and Bugbears.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We should have dispatched this grave injustice when we were here last,&quot; I say. &quot;You have my solemn Oath that we will defeat these villains.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Blessings upon you! I do not know how they swell their numbers, but you should find <em>Farmer Alderleaf</em>. She is both cunning and practical, and may know something to aid in your quest.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The farm looks like it hasn’t been used in awhile, but the house looks strong. <em>Geral</em> knocks on the door, and <em>Qelline Alderleaf</em>, a Halfling, answers. She invites us in for a hearty feast. We are grateful and eat, but <em>CoralKing</em> remains hesitant and stands in the corner. She says her son, <em>Carp</em>, might know a secret way to get in the castle. Carp’s friend, <em>Reidoth</em>, is a Druid, and told her about the Undead in the Manor. He seems to have been lured away to <strong>Thundertree</strong> to deal with a Dragon. The Redbrands are well-equipped and led by a Wizard, <em>Glasstaff</em>.</p>
<p>We travel with <em>Carp</em> toward the manor but he is concerned about the noise from our heavy armor. He says if we can just get to this tunnel, we should be good from there. We take off our clanking armor. The tunnel leads to a storeroom but <em>Carp</em> says
there’s a big floating creature in there. <em>Wulrif</em> tries to get <em>Carp</em> to visualize it and then reads his mind, but Carp had fled before he'd gotten a good look at it.</p>
<p><em>Wulrif</em> and <em>Actias</em> confer, saying it’s not a Death Tyrant. I think that's good news? We all discuss and decide it would be best to approach and attempt to negotiate with it, as opposed to coming in hot through the front door. The Redbrand we interrogated
had said they avoid the Beholder, so it and the Redbrands may not have aligned agendas.</p>
<p>We crawl through the tunnel, single file, which is skillfully constructed. We approach the Beholder, but it seems quite mad, rambling gibberish and strange tongues.</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/spectator.png" alt="Beholder" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; it says, finally, in Common.</p>
<p>&quot;We're just passing through to get to the Wizard,&quot; says <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't care but don't touch the Precious!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's the Precious?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The thing I must guard since my summoning. But I don't want to guard it. I don't have to guard it if it's gone, so maybe you could take it and I could leave this place! Except then I'd have to kill you all. Will you take it?&quot; it asks eagerly.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you give it to us?&quot;, asks <em>Wulrif</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;I would if I could, but <strong>my</strong> Wizard won't let me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe you're hungry?&quot; asks <em>Actias</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, no, I make my own food. Are you hungry?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ten stuffed turkeys with all the fixings on plates materialize in front of us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;That's not my kind of food ...&quot; It conjures a pile of something foul-smelling and wriggling, proceeding to slurp the things down with great gusto.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Wulrif</em> studies it really intently. Suddenly, he gives a shriek as if his mind has suddenly grasped things never meant for Human understanding. <em>Wulrif</em> begins greedily grubbing down the same nauseous slush as the Beholder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Ah, now you understand something of what really nourishes us!&quot; It nods sagaciously.</p>
<p>&quot;Ugh, <em>Wulrif</em>, what are you doing!?&quot; exclaims <em>Geral</em>. He manages to pull <em>Wulrif</em> away from his feast, the mad light fading from <em>Wulrif's</em> eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>I think we lost Tysnera and Tasbros here.</em></p>
<p>We are in a crevice which is unusually cold, and it’s a 20 foot climb into the basement of the manor. <em>Actias</em> casts Mold Earth to make a very convenient ramp for us to walk up.
Topside, the crevice is spanned by two narrow wooden bridges. <em>Viker</em> transforms into a mouse and heads West, finding a room with 8 Redbrands.
She goes into the room across the hall and sees 12 Redbrands, eating. One of them throws a dagger at her in disgust. <em>Viker</em> skitters away and reports back. We confer.</p>
<p>I'm going to block the middle of the hallway to control how many can attack us at once. <em>Actias</em> makes the hallway behind us difficult terrain to hopefully slow the others down.
<em>CoralKing</em> stays at the rear of the party to defend us from that direction.</p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Viker</em> casts Moonbeam (what is a Moon?) on the spot where the first Redbrand appears. Ghostly flames envelop him, screaming, as he takes 14 damage.</li>
<li><em>Calmul's</em> Musket misfires and dumps black powder everywhere.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> Hexes and Eldritch Blasts the Redbrand. He goes down.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> holds his action.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> holds his attack.</li>
<li>I hold my attack.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> holds.</li>
<li>Another Redbrand runs out into the Moonbeam; he goes down. A very loud alarm rings throughout the whole manor. Another Redbrand comes out of the room, and I slice him in half. Yet another Redbrand gets flamed by <em>Viker's</em> Moonbeam.</li>
<li>Half of the Redbrands start to come out the back hallway, so <em>CoralKing</em> moves to face them. A Redbrand shoots and hits him for 4 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> shoots and crits the guy over my shoulder.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> backs up to come help <em>CoralKing</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 2</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Viker</em> maintains concentration on Moonbeam.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> repairs his Musket.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> backs up to get a better view of both streams of Redbrands, over one of the bridges. It collapses and he falls down into the chasm, taking 4HP damage.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> moves back to get in a more strategic position and holds his action.</li>
<li>A Fireball goes off! But everyone makes their saving throws, only taking 16 damage.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> holds his action.</li>
<li>I hold my action.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> forks his Eldritch Blast. He lands both and does 20 damage! That Redbrand goes down, as does the one coming at <em>CoralKing</em>.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> hits the new approaching Redbrand in front of him, doing 6 damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 3</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Viker</em> moves through the hallway to move her Moonbeam into the room with most of the Redbrands. One of them takes an opportunity attack as she moves by and crits her with 12 damage. She manages to maintain her Moonbeam.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> shoots a Redbrand and deals 5 damage.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> seems to be talking again with the Beholder in the chasm.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> Flurries 3 hits, but they all miss. Then he and <em>Actias</em> make Wisdom saving throws, succeeding. Something was trying to paralyze them.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> moves up to protect <em>Viker</em> and hits a Redbrand for 8 damage. He uses an Action Surge and hits for another 8 HP.</li>
<li>I move to protect <em>Viker</em> and hold my action.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> splits his Eldritch Blast to hit 2 Redbrands. He misses one but hits another for 7 damage, knocking him down. He retreats across the remaining bridge and finds a <strong>HUGE</strong> new group of Redbrands,
including the Wizard, lurking just around the corner!</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> immediately gets hit by 2 swords, taking 12 damage total. <em>CoralKing</em> takes 15 damage from a volley of arrows and Fades Away. <em>Calmul</em> takes more arrows for 13 HP. <em>Actias</em> does a quick Rebuke on one of the archers, doing 7 damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 4</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Viker</em> moves her Moonbeam and kills a Redbrand. She uses a Bonus action to say a Healing Word on <em>Calmul</em> for 9 HP.</li>
</ol>
<p>The players have decided to take a pause here and take up the fight again next week.</p>

<p>Round 4, continued</p>
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 -->
<ol start="2">
<li><em>Benjamin</em> shoots his bow twice at a soldier and hits! He does 12 damage.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> shoots at the archer that <em>Benjamin</em> just hit and misses.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> found her way back to the group with <em>Tasbros</em>. They walk up the ramp from the tunnel to see the battle scene. She shoots a Firebolt at the same archer and misses.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> tries to spell magic and other stuff the group is not privy to</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> runs down the hallway near <em>Viker</em> and dashes to safety.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> leaps inside the south room a few soldiers are in and screams “for the irregulars!!! Orky, that’s what I call us now!” and hits one soldier for 13 damage.</li>
<li>I hold my action.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> makes a sword-in-a-stone situation in front of him.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> gets out of the pit and tries to deal Chromatic Orb on a leather-clad man east of the fight, at the mouth of a hallway. He decides poison damage and misses his attack. He then makes everyone within 30 ft of him invisible, somehow. If anyone invisible makes an attack, the spell dissolves on that attacker.</li>
<li>The bad guys go now…
<ul>
<li>A bizarre spell is cast and everyone is visible again.</li>
<li>b. Geral gets attacked by 4 people in that room. 3 Hits for 15 damage total.</li>
<li>The southern enemies move west toward our group and the north enemies move east.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> gets hit once for 8 HP.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> gets hit for 8 HP.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> is hit twice for 8 HP.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> gets hit again for 14 HP.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> gets hit by a sword twice for 15 HP.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> gets hit for 8 HP, even though he’s in the pit hanging out with the Beholder.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> gets hit for 11 HP.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> dodges a hit and leans right into another one for 8 HP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> hits the injured archer for 12 damage and kills him.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 5</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> hits an archer for 13 damage.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> moves her moonbeam to the southern bridge, which was repaired previously. As a bonus action, she uses her unicorn totem (30 ft radius). Her moonbeam, which she dropped on a poor fool, takes 12 damage and dies.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> hits someone and does some damage?</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> casts a lightning bolt (100 ft long 5 ft wide) for 33 damage on every person hit. So, death.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> hears the screaming from the pit. He casts Misty Step to rejoin the team. He uses his bonus action to place a hex mark on someone.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> holds his action</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> gets his with Magic Missiles and takes 10 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> swings in his room again and kills the guy closest to him. He screams “<em>CoralKing</em>, I could use some help in here!” and gives him 3 temporary HP</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> moves into the south room to help <em>Geral</em>. He attacks twice and once misses. He deals 8 HP damage.</li>
<li>I use Vow of Enmity and moves to the last guy in the large room and kill him. I turn down the north hallway with the rough terrain and kill the first guy I see also.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> casts a Fireball and the enemy wizard reacts and casts a counter spell. He fails, so <em>Tasbros</em> kills scores of men, unfortunately leaving the wizard.</li>
<li>The enemies’ turn:
<ul>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> skillfully bobs and weaves to take no damage on a few attacks.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> misses some attacks but catches one for 11 damage.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> gets hit once for 6 damage. He also gets hit again for 4 damage. The enemies are kind of pissed he roasted their friends.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> shoots his bow and takes out a guy on the south bridge.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 6</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Viker</em> is going to heal <em>Tasbros</em> for 13 damage and everyone gets 5 HP of healing. She takes a guy out.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> shoots an archer for a critical hit and kills him. He takes aim and misses a shot at another guy.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> shoots at the remaining 3 guys by the central pit and misses.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> casts Magic Missile on those 3 guys and hits them for 8 damage.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> Eldritch Blasts one of the guys and kills him.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> uses 3 attacks on a guy and hits all 3 for 32 damage. So, he pulverized him in front of his friends.</li>
<li>The wizard disappears!!!</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> says “well done your highness, go again!” to allow <em>CoralKing</em> to attack again. <em>CoralKing</em> hits one critical and another hit to kill the guy. Geral does some damage on a guy.</li>
<li>I dash to the south room with <em>Geral</em> and <em>CoralKing</em></li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> moves to the edge of the pit and poison sprays one of the guys there. He does 9 damage.</li>
<li>The guy standing in front of me exclaims “I surrender M’lady!” and throws his hands up. We take him prisoner. The other guys retreated in haste.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="1200-xps"><a class="header" href="#1200-xps">1200 XPs</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Viker</em> heals <em>CoralKing</em> 15 HP and everyone else 5 HP.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> uses healing spirit for everyone to walk through. 6 people can walk through it for 1d6 HP healing.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> stands guard in case the magician comes back.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> joins the group and turns on Detect Thoughts.</li>
<li>The group decides what to do with our newfound prisoner and the rest of the castle.</li>
<li>I ask the prisoner: “Who else is in the castle?” He responds “No one else, our leader ran off and you slew the rest of us.” <em>Geral</em> said “What about the Undead?” He responds: “12 skeletons”. “What about the creature in the pit?” They stay away from the creature in the pit. <em>Tasbros</em>: “Who is your leader?” He responds “<em>Iarno Glasstaff</em>, you are much stronger than him.” <em>Tasbros</em> asks “Where is he going now?” He said “Probably the Black Spider.” <em>Wulrif</em> detects thoughts and it resembles a Drow.</li>
<li>I want to turn the soldier in to the authorities but allow input from the group. I reach for my rope to tie him up and he interjects “I’ll turn myself in to the authorities!” and I nod in agreement. He gets up and leads us to the secret door.</li>
<li>We move to the north secret door, leading to room 7, a storeroom. We see a door opposite the secret door and one to the south. We go through the one closest to us and find an armory. <em>Viker</em> detects magic back toward the pit. <em>Geral</em> finds brand new Scale Mail and grabs it -- no Plate Mail is detected, to my disappointment. <em>Viker</em> and <em>Steve</em> grab Crossbows. <em>Viker</em> grabs a longsword.</li>
<li>We revisit the sword-in-the-stone and <em>Viker</em> casts Detect Magic. She sees an outline of armor buried in the dirt by the sword and an outline of the hilt of the sword. <em>Actias</em> unearths the sword and underneath it is a crypt. There is a sarcophagus in there. This is the burial place of <em>Lord Tresendar</em>.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> speaks to the Beholder kin in his native language. He said he wants to be free after he kills all of us. We decide to leave him alone for now.</li>
<li>We head to room 4, another series of crypts. There are 12 skeletons that rise up to face us.</li>
</ul>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> hits the bow-wielding skeleton (AC 13) and hits, killing it. He attacks a second one and kills another one.</li>
<li>I kill two</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> uses ray of frost and does 5 damage.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> uses ice knife, kills one, and kills another 5 within a 10 ft radius.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> moves between 2 skeletons and attacks them both at the same time. They are particularly vulnerable to blunt damage (open-handed attacks) so they get dealt double damage. He hits one for 10 damage. He uses a bonus attack to deal another 14 damage, killing it.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> uses Firebolt for 19 damage, killing it.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> attacks the last one for 6 damage.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> kills the last one!</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>We see the room was a crypt full of skeletons. The crypts are empty now, obviously. We see another single door, which is where the townsfolk are being held. <em>Wulrif</em> uses a cantrip to clean everyone up. <em>Geral</em> says “we assume you know how to get home?” they say “oh, yes!” he said “ok, just don’t bother the monster in the basement on your way out.”</li>
<li>The double doors are a long hallway and <em>Steve</em> detects a pit trap full of spikes. We go to investigate another room <em>Steve</em> finds, that leads us to the wizard’s workshop. <em>Calmul</em> gets excited seeing a bunch of alchemy equipment (Mercury, Dragon bile, and nightshade). A Dwarven book is available, <em>Wulrif</em> takes it, and it’s a journal about the history of Phandalin. A secret door is ajar that looks like the way the wizard escaped. A letter has been left, written in Common, with a black spider seal on it. A chest is found at the foot of the bed, <em>Viker</em> detects magic within it. <em>Steve</em> uses his crowbar to wedge it open and nearly dodges the poison needle. There are 2 scrolls (Fireball and charm person) and <em>Tysnera</em> takes them both. There are a couple of gems (Ruby, 5 Carnelians, Peridots) 180 silver and 130 gold pieces. Those are most of the rooms other than the crevasse.</li>
<li>The group decides to return to Phandalin, turns the prisoner in, and <em>Sildar</em> asks where <em>Iarno</em> is. We said he fled. We show him the letter and he figures out that <em>Iarno</em> betrayed him. <em>Wulrif</em> asks “Who is the Black Spider?” and <em>Sildar</em> said he doesn’t know. Iarno used to be a battle mage with <em>Sildar</em>. He was helping <em>Sildar</em> and <em>Gundren</em> to set up the mine in Phandalin. <em>Viker</em> asks if there was a love interest that went sour and <em>Sildar</em> said he doesn’t know of any.</li>
<li>We take a long rest while <em>Wulrif</em> reads the letter. He finds a Forge of Spells that describes a magic sword “magic bringer” for Lord Tresendar. He asks about the Beholder and finds that it’s a type of guardian that is bound by a ritual. When a Beholder is slain, and is rebuilt, this creature is what is created.</li>
<li><em>Gundren</em> wants to go to <strong>Wave Echo Cave</strong> and we agree. <em>Wulrif</em> hands over the journal and recognizes it. We said we found the lord’s crypt. He said his daughter (<em>Aliah</em> - a wizard) probably conjured the Beholder. <em>Gundren</em> said the sword (Lightbearer) and armor are very valuable and rare.</li>
<li>We hear a voice along our journey “What are you doing here?” and we look up and see a very large man (30 ft tall) on a cloud staring at us. We state our purpose to travel to <strong>Wave Echo Cave</strong>. He said if we can activate the <strong>Spell Forge</strong>, come back to him and he has a task for us. <em>Geral</em> asks him his name and he responds “<em>Zeus</em>”. We agree and move on.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="journals/images/cloud-giant.png" alt="Cloud Giant" /></p>
<ul>
<li>We hear a booming echo and we see a cave entrance and hear the ocean. <em>Gundren</em> sees a Dwarf body and <em>Gundren</em> gasps and runs toward it. He screams “<em>Thardon</em>!” He turns the body over and sees tiny arrow bolts. <em>Wulrif</em> starts looking at the bolts and they are silvery but crumble in the sunlight. <em>Viker</em> detects magic boots on <em>Thardon’s</em> body. She attempts to pry off the boots and <em>Gundren</em> says “What are you doing? That’s my brother!” She says “…is he using them?” <em>Gundren</em> is taken aback and looks away in hesitant approval. The boots suddenly resize (Boots of Striding and Springing) to her feet.</li>
<li>We drop down further into the cave and cannot see very far. The <strong>Spell Forge</strong> is a place where magic weapons are made. We are looking for that here.</li>
<li>We decide to head west and it starts becoming a maze of twisty little passages with 6’ high ceilings and several collapsed passageways. We decide to head north. We see a pool with dark water to the west, the shore is full of broken shells and odor. Steps head to the east. <em>Viker</em> detects magic and she sees an outline of something in the pool at the bottom, something small and about 20’ down. <em>Viker</em> turns into an octopus and dives down. She sees a skeleton and grabs a wand of Magic Missiles off the body. She generously gives it to <em>Tasbros</em>.</li>
<li>We head forward on the path and encounter a barricaded door. <em>Viker</em> decides to turn into a centipede and try to find what’s on the other side. She sees 10 bugbears on the other side.</li>
<li>We decide to backtrack down the path and send <em>Steve</em> down the northeastern hallway with <em>Viker</em> on his back. They see a normal, narrow passageway and as we all follow behind, the whole floor and walls start to wrap around and swallow us. We figure out it’s an Ochre Jelly. It’s basically on a jellyfish’s back. Everyone is surprised except for <em>Benjamin</em>, <em>Viker</em>, and <em>Tysnera</em>. They all get attacked.</li>
</ul>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li>Acid damage of 12 for <em>Geral</em>, 8 for <em>Wulrif</em>, 13 for Orky, 16 for <em>CoralKing</em>, 10 damage to <em>Tasbros</em>, 8 to <em>Steve</em>, and <em>Calmul</em> was spared.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> casts Firebolt</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> attempts to find its weaknesses and discovers that it’s resistant to acid, immune to slashing, piercing, and lightning. It has no weaknesses.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> uses Shillelagh and hits for 10 damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now all those who were surprised can act.</p>
<p>Round 2</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> uses ray of frost (AC 8) and does 7 damage.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> hits it with his quarterstaff and does 3 damage.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> headbutts it, with his feet stuck to deal 20 damage.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> hits it for 13 damage.</li>
<li>The jelly goes now and hits everyone with 9 points damage. <em>Tysnera</em> gets hit again for 20 HP. 13 damage to someone and 7 to <em>Benjamin</em>. <em>Calmul</em> gets 13 points of damage.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> uses Chromatic Orb for 28 damage.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> commands <em>CoralKing</em> to hit it again. He deals 21 damage.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> kills it!</li>

<p>We are still in the cave. <em>Steve</em> saw there were some things embedded in the ooze we just exploded. He investigates and finds 20 gp. The whole cave seems magical and there’s a strange draft. There also sounds like a surf sounds, crashing every 2-3 minutes, to the North/Northeast. <em>Tasbros</em> declares his desire to chase the magic. We all decide to head North – toward some stairs. We ask <em>Steve</em> to check for traps:</p>
<ul>
<li>His vision blurs for a bit (rolls a 2) and cannot see any traps.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> investigates the stairs. The stairs seem solid and well-designed.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> uses Luck</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> doesn’t find anything other than the stairs seem to be made for Dwarves</li>
</ul>
<p>We head down the stairs and find ourselves in a large cavern with some ledges, tables, and dozens of warrior skeletons. It looks like a battle occurred here a long time ago, but they smell. Some gray ghoulish creatures start to rise and approach us. They don’t lurch, but move quicker.</p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> Hexes the first creature and does 13 damage (AC 13)</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> detect their weaknesses. They are immune to poison &amp; charm. Resistance to necrotic damage. Resistance to being turned. Tougher ones are Ghasts and easier ones are Ghouls.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> casts scorching ray (2nd level) on 3 fresh Ghasts and uses meta magic. He hits them each for 13 damage.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> tells <em>Benjamin</em> to fire his bow! He hits a damaged Ghast that <em>Wulrif</em> hit for 15 damage. <em>Geral</em> hits it again with his bow and does 8 damage, killing it!</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> is at the back of the pack. He moves forward through us and throws 2 darts for 15 damage.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> uses frostbite and does 5 damage.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> moves into the room to shoot and hits a critical shot! That means 16 damage to a damaged Ghast. That one is killed.</li>
<li>The Ghasts attack now:
a. The Ghasts move forward to attack <em>Calmul</em>, Orky, <em>Geral</em>, and <em>CoralKing</em>.
b. They miss <em>Calmul</em>, Orky, and <em>Geral</em>.
c. They critically hit <em>CoralKing</em> and <em>Geral</em> claims protection. They miss!
d. We all have to make a constitution saving throw. Orky got poisoned, which gives her disadvantage on her attacks.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> casts Fireball and hits every creature with 36 HP damage. They are all killed!</li>
</ol>
<p><em>CoralKing</em> picks up all of his darts while we move through the room, east into the next room. There are more skeletons, but nothing moving. <em>Geral</em> decides, after a heated debate between <em>Tasbros</em> and <em>Tysnera</em>, to backtrack and enter the room south of here. This room is full of bunks and there are bones of Orcs and Dwarves, that are being gnawed on by Ghasts and Ghouls. When they see us enter, they attack.</p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> holds her action</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> hits a Ghast for 19 damage.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> hides behind someone and sneak attacks the damaged Ghast, killing it.</li>
<li>Orky moves and attacks a Ghast twice, killing it.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> hits a Ghoul and uses three unarmed attacks and one hit for 6 damage.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> hits the damaged Ghoul for 22 damage, killing it.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> casts ice knife and hits a Ghoul for 10? Damage.</li>
<li>Now the Undead fight back:
a. They all surround Orky and hit her twice for 20 damage.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> casts Firebolt on a Ghast and does 7 damage to it.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> moves forward to attack the Ghast and does 19 damage, killing it!</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> shoots one Ghoul and kills it.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> finally feel prepared to act and hits it for 12 damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 2</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Calmul</em> shoots the remaining Ghoul and does 13 damage.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> uses a sneak attack and kills it!</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Tysnera</em> detects all kinds of magic in this cave. We all take a short rest and decide to take the southern hallway to move east into a room where we find a storeroom full of kegs. We realize it’s a dead end. So, we move west toward the large room we know is full of bugbears.</p>
<p><em>Wulrif</em> uses mage hand and gust to open the door, but it doesn’t open because it’s barricaded. <em>Benjamin</em> gives it a super hard kick and manages to barely kick it in. We see 10 bugbears and a very large one in the back.</p>
<p>Round 1 - Surprise</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Steve</em> hits the first bugbear and does 14 damage.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> hits the same one twice and does 29 damage, bringing it down.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> moves into the room, uses ice knife, misses, and Teleports back out of the room.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> marks the big one and throws him into the wall using eldritch ray behind him for 17 damage.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> throws 2 darts at the marked bugbear for 12 damage.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> holds his action</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> casts Fireball and the bugbears make their saving throws. So, they get hit for 14 damage each.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> casts Fireball and the bugbears make their saving throws again. So, they all take 16 damage, which drops them all except the big one and the marked one.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> takes his action to ask <em>Benjamin</em> to shoot his bow. He hits the marked one for does 13 damage. <em>Geral</em> hits the same one and drops it.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> shoots at the bugbear and misses.</li>
<li>Orky Teleports to the leader, and attacks him twice for 16 total damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 2</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Steve</em> misses an attack</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> shoots at the leader and missed the first. He tries again and hits, doing 12 damage, killing it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we hear a voice say “oh, that’s a shame. I guess I have to deal with you now.” <em>Wulrif</em> detects thoughts and gets nothing. We hear: “what brings you here anyway?” <em>Wulrif</em> responds “We are here for some treasure.” And it responds “Well, you should find another place for that. You’ll find nothing but death here. I know what I’m looking for, do you?” We say “What are you looking for?” No response. “We’re here for <em>Gundren</em>’s brother.” The voice says “We have him.”</p>
<p>We all make saving throws + DEX. We need a 16 to make it. A Fireball detonated in the middle of the room. <em>Geral</em>, <em>Viker</em>, Orky,  and <em>Tysnera</em> failed, taking 34 damage. Next, we are in the middle of a yellow-green fog. We all have to use a constitution saving throw. Those who roll 15, make it. <em>Geral</em> and <em>Wulrif</em> failed.</p>
<p>We see a Drow and a human run out of room and 4 spiders run into the room. Orky gets an opportunity of attack and delivered 15 damage.</p>
<p>Round 3</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Steve</em> makes a death saving throw and misses.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> uses hunter’s mark on the damaged Spider and shoots twice and kills it.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> uses Healing Word and everyone gets healed 5 HP.</li>
<li>The spiders go now:
a. One hit Orky for 4 HP damage, reduced from 7.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> blasts a Spider back and does 17 damage.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> moves forward to attack the damaged Spider, flanking Orky. He rolls a crit and does 28 damage and kills it!
Everyone in the room has to make a saving throw + CON on the start of their turn, if they started in the fog at the beginning of their turn (15 makes it). No one has failed so far.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> casts Dispel Magic and rids the room of the poison fog.</li>
<li>The spiders make a web around Orky, but she managed to fight her way out of it.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> uses Magic Missile and does 3 damage to one and 5 to another.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> ?</li>
<li>Orky kills the most damaged Spider.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 4</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> uses healing spirit on <em>Viker</em> for 8 HP.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> uses a potion of healing in her backpack, she drinks it and gains HP.</li>
<li>The giant Spider missed an attack on Orky.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> takes a potion out of <em>Calmul</em>’s backpack and gains 6 HP.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> hits the Spider 3 times for 20 HP</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> asks Orky to hit the Spider and she kills it!</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> burns the web out of the doorway.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> moved forward a little and holds her action.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> heals <em>Steve</em> for 10 HP.
We decide to take some time to heal up. <em>Viker</em> heals <em>Steve</em> for 20 HP. <em>Benjamin</em> heals a lot of people. <em>Viker</em> heals Orky and <em>CoralKing</em> for 7 and 10 HP. And so on…</li>
</ol>
<p>We ask <em>Steve</em> to sneak around the corner where we saw someone run away. He peaks around and doesn’t see anyone. We follow him in pursuit. We end up following the source of magic and <em>Tysnera</em> notices footsteps. We end up at fully-sealed double doors that we cannot see a way to penetrate. <em>Tasbros</em> remembers that he can cast “Knock” and we blow the door open. We see a Drow and a wizard, <em>Glasstaff</em>.</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/Nezznar.png" alt="Nezznar the Black Spider" /></p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> attempts to enter the room and a bunch of tentacles spring up from the floor.
a. <em>Wulrif</em> uses a Counter spell and disintegrates them.
b. He dashes to the wizard.</li>
<li>The rest of us make DEX saving throws and those who make it, take 14 damage. We all used various methods to make the throws.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> hits a Drow?</li>
<li>A Drow sends a flame and <em>CoralKing</em> makes a saving throw and fails. He takes 9 damage.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> casts Chromatic Orb on the wizard for 31 damage, killing him.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> Eldritch Blasts the Drow onto the star space, doing 19 damage.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> uses Magic Missile and they get absorbed into a special spot.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> casts moonbeam and the Drow uses a Counterspell to block it.</li>
<li>Orky casts Hold Person and the Drow succeeds on it’s wisdom saving throw.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> tries to shoot and misses.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> shoots at it and misses.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> moves in 30 ft and tells <em>Benjamin</em> to shoot. He shoots the Drow for 21 damage. Geral uses his action surge and hits it for 3 damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 2</p>
<ol>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> hits twice for 13 damage.</li>
<li>The Drow tries to go invisible and <em>Wulrif</em> counters his spell, so he remains visible.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> hits him and does 20 damage and knocks him down.</li>
<li>We pause the gameplay here.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Drow, <em>Nezznar the Black Spider</em>, has Elven Chain Mail and a Staff of the Spider. The human, <em>Sildar's</em> erstwhile friend <em>Iarno Glasstaff</em>, has a Staff of Defense. The Bugbear leader had a Sentinel Shield.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Six cracked marble pillars line the walls of this hall, at the north end of which stands a nine-foot-tall statue of a Dwarf seated on a throne, a mighty stone Warhammer across his lap. Large emeralds gleam in the statue’s eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have tied and gagged the Wizard and the Drow. <em>Gundren</em> brings in a shield for us that has an eye on it, which turns out to be a Shield of Alertness.
<em>Geral</em> takes it.</p>
<p><em>Tysnera</em> casts Ritual Identify on the objects. <em>Wulrif</em> shuts the door and locks it, I guard it. <em>Wulrif</em> hears a voice in his head “Can you take the gag off? You don’t have to worry about me.” He angrily casts a cantrip on the prisoner and tells him to speak out loud. He rips out the gag. The Drow threatens us to talk to him now or he will hunt us down and kill us, then haunt us forever. <em>Wulrif</em> puts the gag back on. <em>Actias</em> uses Mage Hand to retrieve a key from around the Drow's neck.</p>
<p><em>Actias</em> and <em>Wulrif</em> investigate the statue and find the emeralds are fake. <em>Tasbros</em> casts Detect Magic and finds Abjuration magic on the statue. <em>Geral</em> asks <em>Gundren</em> if the statue is made by Dwarves. He confirms that it is and that the gems are fake. <em>Gundren</em> walks over to the table to read the notes on it. He finds a Potion of Healing and <em>Viker</em> takes it. <em>Gundren</em> thinks <em>Sildar</em> would want the two hostages returned to <strong>Phandalin</strong> to stand trial.</p>
<p><em>Gundren</em> starts walking towards the second door that seems to be locked. “Does anyone have a key?” <em>Wulrif</em> exclaims that he found a key just now and walks over to unlock the door but hesitates as we need to explore the room further.</p>
<p><em>Wulrif</em> decides to interrogate <em>Iarno</em> about <em>Gundren</em>’s brother. <em>Wulrif</em> tells him to speak or we will cut his hand off. He finally concedes that his brother is in the other room. <em>Viker</em> turns into a fly to investigate. She sees a bound Dwarf in there with some other stuff. She returns and relays the information to us.</p>
<p>I, <em>Tasbros</em>, and <em>Tysnera</em> go clear the rest of the room. We find maps of the cave and vague directions of where the spell forge is. We find a bunch of treasure and a mug. We give the treasure to <em>Gundren</em> to hold onto until we get back.</p>
<p>Everyone else opens the door and <em>Gundren</em> rushes in to the Dwarf. He needs to be healed so we give the potion to him. <em>Gundren</em> told us about a room full of Undead with one door. He tells us of a cellar we can retreat to for protection. We start figuring out where the Undead are and sense we are probably being closed in on. We strategize about which way to move through the caves toward the spell forge.</p>
<p>We march on through the bugbear room we cleared earlier…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A blast furnace and a mechanical bellows powered by a waterwheel dominate this large chamber. The furnace is cold and dark, but heaps of coal are piled nearby, along with carts full of unrefined ore. The waterwheel sits in a ten-foot-wide channel cut into the floor of the room, but the channel is dry. Passages exit to the west, south, and east. The empty channel exits to the north and east.</p>
<p>More than a dozen withered corpses are scattered around the room. These slain Dwarves and orcs are still wearing the remnants of their armor. Floating above them is a skull engulfed in green flame. A rotting eyeball creature rises to attack, as do the fallen warriors.</p>

<li><em>Benjamin</em> shoots at the last one twice and hits it for 27 damage, killing it!</li>
</ol>
<p>Benjamin casts Healing Spirit and
<em>Viker</em> heals <em>Geral</em> and everyone else. We find nothing else in this room beside exits and magic in the northeast corner. Calmul heals his Steel Defender. We decide to attune the staffs we have, using a short rest. We exit this room via the northeast corridor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Welcome,&quot; says a voice belonging to a large, hooded, snakelike creature with a strangely friendly face.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; says Tysnera. She senses its nature. &quot;We are tired and in need of rest -- will you protect us?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; it replies. &quot;Congratulations on defeating all of those Undead. Well, most of them anyway -- the vengeful spirit of the Wizard will be back in a few cycles.&quot;</p>
<p>Gundren steps forward. &quot;We have the deed to Phandelver Mine.&quot; He presents an ornately written scroll from the <strong>Neverwinter Archives</strong>.</p>
<p>&quot;I care not for such things, only that the hearts of those who would wield the power of the <strong>Spell Forge</strong> are true.&quot; Its head sways from side to side as it examines the party in minute detail. &quot;You must leave at once,&quot; it says to <em>Wulrif</em>.</p>
<p>Wulrif doesn't argue.</p>
<p>&quot;You need the combined knowledge of an Artificer and a Wizard,&quot; it continues.</p>
<p>&quot;We have,&quot; replies <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Those that use the <strong>Spell Forge</strong>, I must lay a Geas upon them. On their heads be it if a weapon made in the <strong>Spell Forge</strong> is used for evil purposes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I accept,&quot; says Tysnera.</p>
<p><em>Calmul</em> makes a strange growling noise in his throat.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not,&quot; he finally says.</p>
<p>&quot;Then you must also leave,&quot; replies the Guardian.</p>
<p>&quot;Now,&quot; it says once <em>Calmul</em> has gone, &quot;let me teach you the secrets of the <strong>Spell Forge</strong>. I have but a few centuries.&quot;</p>
<p>Tysnera and the Guardian confer at length while the rest of the party takes a long rest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Tysnera</em> learns that the <strong>Spell Forge</strong> can bind the following spells to weapons permanently:</p>

<p><em>Geral</em> is singled out and asked to bring this mine back into operation and protect the mine. He is asking to be replaced for a short period of time. <em>Geral</em> said he needs to arrange a small militia to do that and agrees.</p>
<p>Steve found some magic gauntlets on the corpse of a Dwarf, which <em>Tysnera</em> identifies as Gauntlets of Ogre Power. <em>Geral</em> takes them.</p>

<p>The Naga stares unblinking with piercing golden eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;The Wizard's spirit will reform and must be satisfied, or it will continue to haunt the mine.
But the greatest threat is the creeping doom near the old entrance.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Orky</em> is strangely entranced by the greenish flames of the <strong>Spell Forge</strong>.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, it is fighting against corruption. Perhaps ...&quot;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The group finds a Mace of Disruption and a Dragon Breastplate. Taking a short rest, <em>Viker</em> attunes to the Mace as the
party heals and prepares. <em>Geral</em> slips off his sturdy Scale Mail and dons the Breastplate.</p>
<p>Outside the room, there is a cry and a thudding on the doors.</p>
<p><em>Calmul</em> has been attacked by a flock of Stirges. His Steel Guardian dispatched one of the creatures, but three are now embedded
in his scaly hide, gorging on blood. <em>Calmul</em> falls to the ground as <em>Geral</em> runs to pull the things off of him. The party
dispatches the rest. <em>Benjamin</em> heals <em>Calmul</em> from the brink of death.</p>
<p><em>Wulrif</em> is nowhere to be seen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He is ... delving into the occult mysteries of this place,&quot; says <em>Actias</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No further explanation is forthcoming.</p>
<p>Revived, re-equipped, and resolute, <em>Geral</em> leads the group. The <strong>Spell Forge</strong> lies on a Dwarven-carved platform amidst a large natural cavern,
stairs leading down to the living rock. There lie quarters for the Artificers and Wizards of ages past, with a further tunnel leading south. The party approaches the doors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dust, ash, walls blackened by fire, and heaps of debris beneath the sagging ceiling show that this room was damaged by a destructive blast.
The furnishings -- tables, chairs, bookshelves, beds -- are charred or splintered, but otherwise well preserved.
A scorched iron chest stands near the foot of one of the beds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Steve</em> stealthily creeps into the room, searching for traps. Bringing out his Thieves' Tools, he carefully picks the lock, nods once in satisfaction, then creeps back out.
<em>Tasbros</em> concentrates for a bit and opens the chest with his Mage Hand.</p>
<p>Inside the chest are heaps of copper, silver, and electrum coins from an ancient age, as well as 3 huge diamonds and a finely wrought wooden pipe with platinum filigree.</p>
<p>A shadowy form rises from the floor. It speaks in grave whispers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Your presence is offensive to me, your life forfeit. My treasures are mine alone, not yours to plunder!&quot;</p>
<p><em>Geral</em> says, &quot;We do not seek to disturb you, only rid this place of its invaders. How may we help you find peace?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is true that I fell defending this place from the Orcs and their Shaman. I summoned the Guardian before I died,
so the <strong>Spell Forge</strong> would not be defiled after my passing. Yet defiled this place remains!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have sworn an oath to protect this place,&quot; says <em>Geral</em>. &quot;We have slain the restless spirits of your attackers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed?&quot; it muses. &quot;I see that you speak truth. Yet a creeping doom remains.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well then, we shall dispatch that as well. What would you have us do with your treasures?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I care not for the coinage, only that the flute remain undisturbed. I see you have a Wizard amongst you.
I learned mighty spells in life but no longer have need for my accoutrements of learning.
You may take these things in exchange for a token of your success against the Unnamed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We will be back&quot;, says <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;We will see,&quot; it says, disappearing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Tysnera</em> eagerly inscribes from the Spellbook of <em>Mormesk the Magnificent</em>:</p>

<li>Cantrips: Acid Splash, Friends, Lightning Lure, Mage Hand</li>

<li>5th: Cloudkill, Summon Draconic Spirit</li>
</ul>
<p>The party continues on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dense carpets of weird fungi cover large sections of the floor in this cavern. The growth includes puffballs a foot across, weird shelf fungus growing on stalagmites,
and large stalks and caps a good five feet tall. Some of the puffballs glow with an eerie green phosphorescence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Tasbros</em> has a thought. Motioning the party back, he aims a Fire Bolt at one of the puffballs.</p>
<p>The resulting blast singes his eyebrows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We can't cast any Fireballs in there&quot;, <em>Tasbros</em> says. <em>Geral</em> nods glumly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further travel into the cavern reveals the air is filled with choking spore clouds. The party looks to <em>Geral</em> who nods. Everyone makes a dash for the exit.</p>
<p>The trap is sprung!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Emerging from the weird fungal carpets, two giant-sized Skeletons dripping with greenish slime stand up to block the exit.
Behind the party, four huge mounds of sticky black sludge pulsate as they crawl from the floor and ceiling to block the tunnel the party just came through.
Swarming along the stalactites are at least eight blobs of what look to be chaotic molten stone.
In the far back corner of the cavern, a horrifying Undead fungal abomination sends pulses of eldritch power towards the party.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="journals/images/undead-ooze.jpg" alt="Undead Ooze" /></p>
<p>Writhing black tentacles burst from the ground, attempting to envelop the party. Everyone except <em>Tasbros</em>, <em>Tysnera</em> and <em>Viker</em> manage to dodge aside.</p>
<p>Fast on the draw, <em>Benjamin</em> sends two quick arrows into the Ooze Master, but they do little except corrode in its substance.</p>
<p><em>Calmul</em> carefully aims his Musket center-mass on a Gray Ooze and fires. The resulting sharp stab of Psychic pain leaves him breathless. <em>Calmul</em>'s Steel Defender intercepts a black waving pseudopod meant for him.</p>
<p><em>Geral</em> looks around at the party, desperately searching for weapons that will harm their attackers. He puts away his sword and takes out his hand axes, moving to draw the four Black Puddings away from the spellcasters
while <em>Benjamin</em>, <em>Viker</em>, and <em>Actias</em> engage the attackers to the front.</p>
<p><em>Steve</em> hides and looks for an opportunity.</p>
<p><em>Viker</em> shimmers and disappears from the grasp of a tentacle, reappearing with a pop of displaced air next to the Ogre Skeletons. She attacks with her Mace of Disruption.</p>
<p><em>Actias</em> casts Bane on the Ogre Skeletons.</p>
<p><em>Tasbros</em> frees himself from the Black Tentacles.</p>
<p>A deadly greenish Cloudkill erupts in the middle of the party. Everyone but <em>Actias</em> manages to leap aside; <em>Geral</em> is trapped between the Black Tentacles and Cloudkill.</p>
<p><em>Benjamin</em> summons a Guardian Beast, sending it to attack the Black Puddings alongside <em>Calmul</em>'s Steel Defender. They take heavy damage in return.</p>
<p><em>Geral</em> attacks the Ogre Skeletons alongside <em>Viker</em>; a huge club swing, thanks to <em>Actias</em>' Bane, barely misses pulping him against the wall.</p>
<p><em>Steve</em> hits a Black Pudding with a club.</p>
<p><em>Viker</em> does heavy damage on an Ogre Skeleton, barely missing getting pulped in return (again due to Bane).</p>
<p><em>Actias</em> lies unconscious in the deadly Cloudkill.</p>
<p><em>Tasbros</em> attempts Dispel Magic on the Cloudkill, but fails.</p>
<p><em>Tysnera</em> frees herself.</p>
<p>The Black Puddings destroy the Guardian Beast and Steel Defender, turning their attention to the party. <em>Benjamin</em> gets badly mauled, nearly dying, but manages to get Healing Spirit up just in time to save himself.</p>
<p><em>Calmul</em> Repairs his Steel Defender.</p>
<p><em>Geral</em> intercepts Black Pudding attacks on <em>Benjamin</em>.</p>
<p><em>Steve</em> pulls <em>Actias</em> out of the CloudKill.</p>
<p><em>Viker</em> invokes her Unicorn Totem and heals <em>Benjamin</em> and <em>Actias</em> from the brink of death, along with the rest of the party.</p>
<p><em>Actias</em> wakes up and casts a spell on himself, then rushes amongst the Oozes triggering attacks and repercussions.</p>
<p><em>Tasbros</em> tries Chromatic Orb at the Ooze Master, to no effect.</p>
<p><em>Tysnera</em> casts a Lightning Bolt which she curves around <em>Actias</em>, <em>Geral</em>, and <em>Benjamin</em>. It electrocutes the Grey Oozes but splits the Black Puddings!</p>
<p>An Ogre Skeleton misses pulping <em>Tasbros</em> due to Bane.</p>
<p><em>Benjamin</em> casts Healing Spirit again.</p>
<p><em>Tysnera</em> casts Dagger Ward on <em>Calmul</em>'s Steel Defender, which then rushes at the eight smaller Black Puddings, shredding them.</p>
<p>After a few more rounds of desperate battling, <em>Viker</em> Fey Steps over to the Undead Ooze Master and strikes it with her Mace of Disruption. It explodes!</p>

<p><em>Benjamin</em> thinks the Oozes came from the <strong>Underdark</strong>, but we can't find any large passages.</p>
<p>We decide to contract some Dwarves to plug up any holes to the <strong>Underdark</strong> we find. We collect our treasure from the Wraith to hire a militia. We got 150 gp per person. 1 gp per cycle is a ton of money for a solider is a lot of money. <em>Geral</em> is considering paying them 1 sp per day.</p>
<p><em>Gundren</em> pulls <em>Geral</em> aside and shows him an Elven airship (~150 ft long) that has landed and the crew is approaching us. They seem friendly. <em>Tasbros</em> talks to them and they said they notice we activated the <strong>Spell Forge</strong> and he wants to trade so they can access items of power. <em>Geral</em> asks <em>Gundren</em> who built the <strong>Spell Forge</strong>. He doesn't know, but thinks the Elves and Dwarves had an agreement previously. <em>Geral</em> asks Airship Captain how he knew we cleared it. He said it sang to them along the <strong>Ley Lines</strong> as soon as it was freed. He says his name is <em>Varbation Starsight</em> and the <strong>Elendil</strong> is his Airship. <em>Geral</em> introduces himself and shows interest in creating a trade agreement. <em>Varbation</em> offers 5% of the value of the items they make. <em>Geral</em> mentions the Drow we captured to <em>Varbation</em>, who will take it to the <strong>High Courts of Judgement</strong>. An Elven Air Marshall walks over to the Drow and puts some sort of magical cuffs on the Drow, preventing spellcasting. <em>Geral</em> talks to <em>Gundren</em> about what happened with the Wraith. He agreed that we should find some way to let him pass on. <em>Gundren</em> seems suspicious that this creature is a Wraith, he thinks it could be a Ghost.</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/aeraval.png" alt="Aeraval" /></p>
<p><em>Gundren</em> says his clan is under attack by Giants. He will give us 15% if we save his family. We wholeheartedly agree and jump on the airship to find them. We ascend very quickly and set off!</p>
<p>We see a very large Dwarven Mining Crawler that is being pounded on by very large humanoids. We are all handed a Quaal's Feather Token by <em>Varbation</em> and told not to lose it and just jump off the edge of the <strong>Elendil</strong>. We count 11 Giants and 12 Ogres with various equipment on them. Ten of the Giants are massive but one is super jacked, a Fire Giant. Ogres are on the front trying to jam the door open. <em>Geral</em> decides we should land in front of the door and protect that first. The magic folk should land on top of the Dwarven Mining Crawler.</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/Sandcrawler.png" alt="Crawler" /></p>

<li><em>Calmul</em> shoots at the Giant and missed.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> hits the Giant and does 20 damage, taking it out! Finally we win!</li>
</ol>
<p>The vehicle cannot move because there are a ton of clubs stuck in the tracks. We need some large people to help pull them out. We use Charm on the Fire Giant that is still alive to try and get him to pull the vehicle. We surround the Fire Giant, weapons raised, and <em>Wulrif</em> commands the Fire Giant to fix the vehicle. He complies and then, finished, starts walking away, proudly. We let him go. He takes off a chain, puts it on the ground, and steps through a what is now a portal, disappearing. The Dwarves are very happy and we inspect the vehicle. It has these weird things that makes food. We take a long rest now.</p>

<p>We ride back in the crawler with a hundred Dwarves. They thank us and want to throw a big feast in our honor. There’s an award ceremony where they make <em>Benjamin</em> a Scout and is given a quiver with magic arrows. <em>CoralKing</em> is made a Mystic. <em>Calmul</em> is made an honorary Smith. <em>Geral</em> is awarded the title of Thane. I am named a Champion. <em>Steve</em> is made a Spy. <em>Tysnera</em> and <em>Tasbros</em> are made War Mages. <em>Viker</em> is made a Guardian. <em>Wulrif</em> and <em>Actias</em> are made Mystics. We are all given a +1 Cloak of Protection with the <em>Rockseeker Clan</em> symbols.</p>
<p>We are headed to Phandalin to deliver <em>Iarno Glasstaff</em> to <em>Sildar</em> and deal with the demi-Beholder again. As we walk along the path, 2 dinosaurs jump out as us and they look hungry. <em>Benjamin</em> speaks with the dinosaurs. He convinced them to go eat the brontosaurus instead. We finally make it to Phandalin.</p>
<p>We head to the Townmaster’s Hall first to deliver <em>Iarno</em>. <em>Sildar</em> throws him in jail. He reminds us that we are in midsummer and used to have a ward stone to protect them from the Undead during Winternight. However, it has been befouled? And doesn’t work. Usually a whole church blesses a ward stone, so not an easy thing to obtain. They are usually 200+ lbs so we would need a wagon to haul it. Alternatively, there’s another haunted mine fortress 15 miles south of here called <strong>Axeholm</strong> that we can take instead. <strong>Savra's Cathedral</strong> is where we can go to recover an unused ward stone.</p>
<p><em>Sildar</em> also reminds us that there are a ton of Dragons that have been flying around lately. A Dragon-laying sword can be found nearby where a famous hero slayed a Dragon.</p>
<p>We decide to head to <strong>Tresendar Manor</strong> to recover the magic armor in the basement, then get the Dragon-slaying sword. We walk into the basement and see the Spectator.</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/spectator.png" alt="Spectator" /></p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> investigates to learn the creature’s weaknesses. He returns to report that it has no weaknesses and it floats 20 ft above the ground. So, outside of melee range. It cannot be knocked prone.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> hides</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> enhances my weapon. It deals an extra 1d4 poison damage for an extra minute. He casts heroism on me too which gives me temporary hp every round.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> moves behind the creature and holds his action but uses patient defense.</li>
<li>The creature psychically attacks <em>CoralKing</em> but he resists it. I get paralyzed. <em>Geral</em> survives the attack as well. <em>Tasbros</em> takes 16 hp of damage.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> orders <em>Steve</em> to shoot his bow. For his second attack, <em>Geral</em> hits?</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> Hexes it and it rebounds, hexing <em>Wulrif</em>. His 2 Eldritch Blasts miss, rebound, and miss <em>Wulrif</em>.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> goes up to it and uses her boots of spring to jump up and hit it with her mace, then Teleports before she lands. She does 4 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> throws a dagger at it and does 4 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> moves back a little, uses his crossbow to shoot it ,and misses.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> creates a magical crossbow and shoots it, killing it.</li>
</ol>
<p>The spectator dissipates and a tiny one appears, attracted to <em><em>Wulrif</em>'s</em> magic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A questing tendril of thought caresses <em>Wulrif</em>’s mind. He allows it to develop.</p>
<p>You are powerful?</p>
<p>Yes, he replies.</p>
<p>You will become more powerful?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You seek the truth of my home?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You will take care of me?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Then I will serve, provided all those conditions remain true.</p>
<p>A wobble in his vision, and now he sees a huge cloaked figure below him, gazing up at him with two tiny, sharp eyes. He floats downwards, closer, as a strange appendage ending in five tentacles produces a morsel. He looks into his own smiling face ….</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Wulrif</em> grabs it and puts it in his bag and begins feeding it. I make a max saving throw and recovers her movement.</p>
<p><em>Tasbros</em> uses move earth to dig, and we see a life-size statue. He detects magic and sees the sword hilt is magic and the tomb. He uses mage hand to lift the sword and it can’t do anything. Me and <em>Geral</em> climb up to the statue and I feel a question in my mind, &quot;Am I trustworthy?&quot; I say &quot;Yes&quot; and the sword drops and I grab it. It’s like a Lightsaber. It’s called a Sun Blade and I humbly pass it to <em>Actias</em> to use. <em>Tasbros</em> uses knock to open the tomb. He sees a body covered in dwarven-made armor. I take it.</p>
<p>We then head to the Cathedral. <em>Geral</em> stops by the Townmaster first and wants to know where the gnome mercenaries came from. They came from <strong>Gnomengarde</strong> and get paid 60 gp each Summerday and 120 gp each Winternight. <strong>Gnomengarde</strong> is 15 miles southeast of <strong>Phandalin</strong>. <em>Benjamin</em> has Animal Handling so he can use a mule to haul a cart. We do all of that and move along. We see a Dragon in the distance but make it to the Cathedral without trouble. <em>Steve</em> goes ahead and scouts the premises, detecting 2 dozen Orcs and 2 dozen Ogres in the courtyard and guard towers. 4 Orcs are in each guard tower (adding 16 to the total) and Ogres are in the courtyard. He has no idea how many more are inside the actual building.</p>
<p><em>CoralKing</em> approaches the Cathedral using <em>Wulrif</em>’s megaphone saying he wants the ward stone. An Ogre approaches asking him to repeat it. <em>CoralKing</em> said he wants the ward stone or else. It says “what’s a warthumb?” <em>CoralKing</em> said “give us the ward stone or else”. He said “what do you mean ‘or else’ I will crush you.” A smaller Ork approaches and inquires the same. <em>CoralKing</em> repeats that we want the ward stone and they respond that they have no idea what we are talking about. They said they have heard of our group and they outnumber us. He tells them about <strong>Axeholm</strong> where they can relocate. They said they just encountered a Dragon and arrived here shortly before, they are not moving. <em>CoralKing</em> asks them if we can come in and take a look to identify it.</p>
<p><em>Viker</em> steps up and suggests she transfigure into a fly and flies in to find the stone. She sees 4 Orc spellcasters at the altar chanting around this big glowing rock. This dark figure, avoiding the light, starts to approach <em>Viker</em>. So, she books it back out. One of the Orc spellcasters turns around and shoots her with 4 Magic Missiles. They do 8 HP damage. <em>Viker</em> makes it back out.</p>
<p>Once <em>CoralKing</em> hears about this, he snaps his fingers and we immediately head in to destroy the group.</p>
<p>Round 1</p>

</ol>
<p>Round 2 – I get 4 temporary HP</p>

Others start to move out of the gate and meet <em>Actias</em>, <em>Calmul</em>’s companion, and the shadowspawn. I attack and hit twice doing 35 damage.</li>

<li>The 2 remaining Ogres turn to run into the cathedral. <em>CoralKing</em> hits one for 6 HP on their way. As the last one disappeared, the spears attacking <em>Wulrif</em> disappeared too.</li>
</ol>
<p>We spend the shadowspawn into the cathedral and it dissipates. <em>Actias</em> uses arcana to see if he can discern anything about the darkness. He doesn’t do well and sees that its magical darkness. The darkness seems to bulge out of the cathedral and a voice says “congrats, you got rid of some of my servants.” We say we are only there for the rock. He said “well, we have uses for that rock. However, there are other magic things you can earn.” This cathedral doesn’t seem to be consecrated and that’s the opposite of how a cathedral should be. It’s not keeping Undead away and etc.</p>
<p>I use divine sense and I can sense that there were 4 Fiends, and now there are 5. Clearly the ward stone has been reversed and is useless to us in its current state. So, we ask about the swords and the voice tells us 1 is a rod and is in an ancient dwarven fortress overrun by Undead. Another sword is in a burial mound. A woodland staff in the shape of a tree is in the depths of the forest. A pair of gloves is in the bowels of <strong><a href="journals/../background/neverwinter.html">Neverwinter</a></strong>.</p>

<h4 id="15000-xp"><a class="header" href="#15000-xp">15,000 XP</a></h4>
<p>We see a little girl with black hair and she asks us “so, are you going to take the offer from the demon?” We say no, she tells us the weapons are probably cursed.  She tells us her people are trapped in there with her. Her name is <em>Chiyo</em> and said her people were misled by promises and told lies. She tells us they are summoning more creatures every cycle, there are 5 in there currently. There are shadow demons, Glabrezu which is the main one talking to us. 2 beasts (Hezrous), 2 Chasmes, and 4 Shadow Demons, and 4 corrupted shamans. She said if we go in to attack them, her people will attack them from behind. Her mate is the leader, the one we talked to first. He is being coerced by the shamans. She estimates we are outnumbered. We learn that Glabrezu emits darkness at will. <em>Wulrif</em> attempts to read her mind and fails. She shows us her true form, as an Oni, which are lawful. The ward stone is under the altar, using an active gate to call their own kind, Fiends.</p>
<p><em>Actias</em> is lighting up his sun blade, we take formation and move into the courtyard. We don’t see anything yet.</p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Steve</em> hides and holds his action</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> holds his action</li>
<li>This giant, deafeningly loud, bug flies toward us and <em>Actias</em> and <em>Wulrif</em> both fall unconscious. The proboscis enters <em>Actias</em> and he drops the sun blade. He loses 30 HP and decreases his maximum HP by 30. It’s draining his blood. They are both unconscious for 10 minutes.</li>
</ol>

<li><em>Viker</em> attempts to hit the fat winged creature but fails.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> shoots at the lobster goat creature and misses.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> casts lightning bolt. <em>Calmul</em> gets hit twice for 33 HP damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 4 – I get 4 HP</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Steve</em> does 23 HP damage on the fat winged creature, taking it out!</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> runs closer to the lobster goat creature and dodges.</li>
<li>The shamans hit the Ork but he's OK.</li>
<li>I move, Teleport to the lobster goat, and hits it twice for 48 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> moves up and does 7 HP damage, I do 18 damage, exactly knocking it down.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> moves forward.</li>
<li>Tasbros moves forward and holds his action</li>
</ol>
<p>The Oni yells “wait!” and seems to heal herself. The Ork seems to imply the shamans are his friends and instructs the other Orcs to halt and not attack.</p>
<p>We ask for the stone and she agrees. <em>Geral</em> invites her to stay with us in our town through the winter and he said he will hire her and her people to protect the forge. The Oni instructs us to stay in the light so we don’t have to face the 4 shadow demons lurking in the dark. 3 shamans, 1 Ork chief, 16 Ogres (4 chain brutes), and 23 Orcs remain to work in the forge.</p>

<p>We start by searching the grounds and the cathedral. We find a gift box containing 1200 gp, 13 gems (1000 gp each). We split them evenly and offer <em>Chiyo</em> and <em>Gruumsh, Clanleader of the Icebreakers</em> 2 gems for their help. We also find a staff, sword, a book, and a rod. <em>Tysnera</em> identifies the book as a tome of understanding and we give that to <em>Viker</em>. The rod is a rod of absorption and we hand it to <em>Tasbros</em>. The Staff of Striking goes to <em>CoralKing</em>. The dancing Shortsword goes to <em>Actias</em>. The Orcs mentioned killing a bunch of Vampires. We dispose of the remnants.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chiyo gestures towards <em>Geral</em>, her deep red eyes contemplative and searching.</p>
<p>She negligently waves her hand, and a curtain of darkness surrounds her and <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p>The rest of the group startles a bit. Gruumsh laughs uproariously.</p>
<p>&quot;Had my wife wished to snack upon his marrow,&quot; he declaims, &quot;She would have done it shortly after our fight with the demons.&quot;</p>
<p>He winks.</p>
<p>&quot;She gets hungry after working magic.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's okay,&quot; says <em>Wulrif</em>, concentrating a bit from his litter. The group relaxes, still a bit unsettled in the company of so many Orcs and Ogres.</p>
<p><em>Steve</em> discreetly slips a dagger back into its sheathe. <em>Calmul</em>'s Steel Guardian relaxes from the taut vibrancy of a coiled steel spring, resuming a watchful aspect.</p>
<p>&quot;Mortals words are worthless, <em>Thane Bryn</em>&quot; says <em>Chiyo</em>, seemingly oblivious to the clamor around her.
&quot;You have offered my husband assurances of shelter and loot, but how am I to believe your bond to him will hold once we are amongst your kind?&quot;
&quot;You have something in mind,&quot;  replies <em>Geral</em>.
<em>Chiyo</em> smiles her unsettling tusked grin, her red eyes gleaming. She holds up a six-inch needle, tiny in her hands.</p>
<p>&quot;My people tattoo mutual bonds upon their flesh. If you are true to its inscription, it guards your life. If not ...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What inscription?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You tell me.&quot; <em>Chiyo</em> smiles appraisingly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We need to get the ward stone into our wagon. We decide to use <em>Tasbros</em>’ Telekinesis to lift it into our wagon. As we do this, we see a bird circling, it lands and turns into this little masked person. His mask is half happy and half sad. He starts giving us shit about how fucked up the ward stone is. We use Detect Magic and see he’s magic. He asks us if we know how ward stones work. <em>Actias</em> asks what his intentions are and he just laughs. <em>Wulrif</em> tries to read his mind and it’s strangely missing. <em>Viker</em> invites him to join us on our journey back to Phandalin and calls him old, which pisses him off. He grows and starts rearing up at us. We ask what we can do to keep him happy. He said we will amuse him, he snaps his fingers and the skies start to darken. He snaps his fingers again and we feel the ground start to shake. Then, this massive toothed worm breaks out of the ground behind the group.</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/purple-worm.png" alt="Purple Worm" /></p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> tries to find its weaknesses. He finds out it’s a Purple Worm and it has no weaknesses.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> throws daggers in the girth worm’s mouth, doing 11 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> casts Bane and hits (it has low charisma)</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> uses Shadow Step to move behind the person thing. He hits it for 6 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> casts Banishment and the girth worm disappears! A massive hole is left in the ground where it was.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> tries to compliment him and asks what he wants. He doesn’t respond.</li>
<li>He waves his hand and a telekinetic force slams into <em>Tysnera</em>, blasting her into the girth hole behind us, doing 24 HP damage. She makes her CON saving throw, but is still falling.</li>
<li>I try casting Hold Person, and fail. I declare a Vow of Enmity.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> casts Confusion and it doesn’t affect him. He uses a magic seeking spell and now looks confused.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 2</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> finds this guy has no weaknesses.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> is hiding and uses a sneak attack on his short crossbow, doing 29 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> moves away from the group and casts thunder step, doing 16 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> uses 1 unarmed strike and does 10 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> uses a Feather Fall token. She can see a greenish glow growing closer.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> uses Shillelagh on something?</li>
<li>The guy is no longer confused, kits <em>Tasbros</em> with the telekinetic force, doing 20 HP damage. He is now following <em>Tysnera</em> down the girth hole. Then, he attacks <em>Viker</em>, doing 21 HP damage, throwing her down the girth hole too.</li>
<li>I moves toward him, cast Thunderous Smite and hit the guy twice, doing 35HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> grabs onto <em>Tysnera</em> and sees the green glow.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 3</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> flanks the guy and casts hunter’s mark</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> attacks the guy and does 32 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> casts booming blade and does 27 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> uses Flurry of Blows and his Staff of Striking, doing 36 HP damage</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> is still falling, but keeping her concentration</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> shapechanges into a Bat and starts to fly out of the girth hole</li>
<li>The guy turns into a flying animal, Teleports 60 ft up, and flies 180 ft straight up. He hits <em>Benjamin</em> and does 22 HP damage.</li>
<li>I dash into the girth hole</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> uses his Spider web staff to create a hammock and catch us.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 4</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> passes</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> jumps down the girth hole</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> jumps down the girth hole</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> jumps down the girth hole</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Tasbros</em> makes a web at the bottom of this girth hole. We land on the web on the bottom of this girth hole. We are in a cavern with fungus. Welcome to the <strong>Underdark</strong>, bitches.</p>
<p><em>Tasbros</em> contracts short-term madness and falls unconscious for 7 minutes. He seems fine, but has a sort of twitch to him now. <em>Tysnera</em> detects a fiendish magic everywhere around us. We walk for 2 cycles and find a stream. I fill up my water skin and stand watch while everyone else drinks water. I finally see 9 fat, 2-headed, knuckle-dragging figures approaching. <em>Viker</em> says “hello friend” in Ork. They respond “small food, let’s get em boys!” and attack.</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/ettin.png" alt="Ettins" /></p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> shoots 2 darts at the gold creature, doing 12 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> tries to detect their weaknesses. They have 2 heads so they have great vision, but no weaknesses.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> casts Fireball and hits 6 of these creatures for 31 HP each.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> hides and attacks the copper creature for 16 HP?</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> uses Wall of Fire, level 4, on all of the creatures.  He does 17 HP damage each.</li>
<li>I casts Thunderous Smite and hit 2 creatures, killing the most damaged one.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> casts scorpions on the creatures and activates her Shillelagh.</li>
<li>The creatures attack us and the scorpions. This provokes an opportunity of attack from <em>Viker</em>, and she absolutely obliterates it. I get hit for 7 HP damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 2</p>
<ol>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> moves forward and attacks the yellow creature for 24 HP, killing it!</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> shoots his bow and does 17 HP damage</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> shoots a Fireball and does 31 HP damage to each of them.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> shoots some creatures, sneakily doing 19 damage to a damaged one.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> uses Chromatic Orb, fire damage, doing 24 HP damage to a creature.</li>
<li>I use Vow of Enmity and hit 2 of the creatures, killing one.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> casts Moonbeam, doing 17 HP damage. She uses Shillelagh? Her Scorpion hit on the claws, doing 14 HP on a creature, killing it.</li>
<li>The creatures hit <em>Viker</em>’s Giant Scorpion twice, doing 28 HP damage to it. The other 2 attack me for 26 HP damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 3</p>
<ol>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> attacked one of the creatures, doing 13 HP damage and killed it, then moves behind it to flank it.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> shoots the creatures and does 11 damage.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> uses Magic Missile and does 13 damage to one of the 2 remaining creatures.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> hits one of them using a normal attack, doing 7 damage.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> uses Chromatic Orb, fire, on the creature attacking me.</li>
<li>I delivers the final 2 blows on the creature in front of me.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> casts moonbeam on the last creature, doing 28 HP damage. Her Giant Scorpion takes out the final one!</li>

<p><em>Calmul</em> watches, fascinated, as <em>Chiyo</em> manipulates the needle, tracing intricate patterns of inky blackness across <em>Geral's</em> broad back.</p>
<p><em>Wulrif's</em> familiar zooms over and around the tableau, looking at the scene from many different angles.</p>
<p><em>Chiyo's</em> darkness insulates them from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>A pattern takes shape, fantastic figures depicting battle against infernal forces.</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/geral-tattoo.png" alt="Geral Tattoo" /></p>
<p><em>Geral</em> wakes with a start to a droning, buzzing sound. <em>Calmul</em> is snoring, his Steel Guardian marching resolute circles around the pair.</p>
<p>A feeling he ought to be thinking of something.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The rest of the party is gone</em>, says <em>Wulrif's</em> voice in his mind.</p>
<p>&quot;What has happened?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Gruumsh</em> points to a wide pit in front of the ruined Cathedral gate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A Giant flew in as a little bird and taunted your companions. When they insulted it back, it summoned a Purple Worm from the <strong>Underdark</strong> and attacked.
Your wizard banished the Worm, but by the time we could reach them, it had flung them down the Purple Wormhole and fled.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A Fire Giant?&quot;, asks <em>Geral</em>, thinking of their last enemy commanding the forces attacking the Dwarven Mining Crawler.</p>
<p>&quot;A Smiling One&quot;, said <em>Chiyo</em> darkly. &quot;We know it. We sought its help against the coming of <em>Icewing</em>, but it is playing a different game.
Something fell has happened to the Ordning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ordning?&quot; asks <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;The power structure of Giants. It is complex, and seems to be changing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why would you seek help from Giants against a Dragon?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, you do not know of the Great War fought between Dragons and Giants in ages past. Well, that is a tale for another time --
what are you going to do now?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Geral</em> stares hard at the Purple Wormhole.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;My people,&quot; rumbles <em>Gruumsh</em>, &quot;do not wish to hang about an accursed Cathedral.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still looking, <em>Geral</em> nods. Command places a heavy burden.</p>
<hr />
<p>Except for <em>Benjamin</em>, they never saw it coming.</p>
<p>One moment they were trudging along single file in the weird luminous gloom of the <strong>Underdark</strong>, then darkness cut off that vision.</p>
<p><em>Benjamin</em> starts, avoiding 3 darts before taking 5 more. <em>Orky</em> feel the pricks of bolts and hears her companions slumping into unconsciousness around her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Cease attacking!&quot; A strong, silken female voice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Orky</em> clenches her gauntlets, feeling Divine Power building in her Greatsword.</p>
<p>The Drow Priestess locks eyes with her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Surrender, or your friends will die.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She could smite this woman and a half-dozen of them back into whatever foul pit they crawled from, but then what?</p>
<p>The Drow Elite Guard shuffle, all weapons pointing unerringly at her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Last chance -- then they become fodder for spiders.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Orky</em> stares hard at the half-Drow half-Spider things. They scuttle backwards.</p>
<p>Finally, she nods.</p>
<p>They take her weapons and place magic shackles on her, but know better than to push it further. The huge Spider-centaurs
come forward and, as <em>Orky</em> watches, subdued, her companions are webbed to their broad backs.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Clan women and children march in the center of a hollow square of Ogres, who bear huge loads upon their backs, in a surprisingly disciplined formation. Two shamans break the trail and one follows, some sort of
magic making the passage of the large group both quieter and less discernible. The remaining Orcs range out widely from the group. Two of them, riding Velociraptors, pull up abruptly to <em>Gruumsh</em> and <em>Chiyo</em>, talking
excitedly while their mounts snarl and drool in anticipation. <em>Gruumsh</em> abruptly jumps up onto a raptor as its rider smoothly dismounts. <em>Chiyo</em> blurs and takes to the sky as a large black Raven. The group
comes to a halt as the Orcs run, following their leader. The dismounted Orc rider glares sullenly at <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p>After a time, one of the Shamans cocks his head and then lets out a celebratory cry. The group changes direction and follows the path of the outriders.</p>
<p>A short march leads to the site of a Thunderbeast kill, the Velociraptor mounts already feasting. The Clan makes camp around the savage scene, the Orcs quickly erecting wooden stakes around the perimeter while
the Ogres drop their burdens and begin digging a huge firepit. A Tyrannosaur lurks off in the distance, but a black bird seems to be perched upon its snout.</p>
<p>Great quantities of wood are gathered and much of the meat is cooked in the baking sun. There is dancing and loud ululations that seems to pass for singing in the Clan as everyone gorges upon the kill.</p>
<p>Later, the Ogres tear great strips from the carcass, swelling their packs even larger.</p>
<p>Within a few hours, the Clan dissembles the stakes and leaves the scene.</p>
<p>As the group marches toward <strong>Phandalin</strong>, <em>Geral</em> can see the unmistakable form of the Tyrannosaur partaking in the remains.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You will convince the Humans to co-exist with us?&quot; rumbles <em>Gruumsh</em>, a few hours later.</p>
<p>&quot;I will,&quot; replies <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;We will see,&quot; huffs <em>Gruumsh</em>, as <strong>Tresendar Manor</strong> comes into view.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><img src="journals/images/Ilvarra.png" alt="Ilvarra" /></p>
<p>Captured by the Drow! You wouldn’t wish this fate upon anyone, yet here you are — on a platform suspended by spiderwebs above a seemingly endless abyss, the cold, heavy weight of metal tight around your throat and wrists. You are not alone. Other prisoners are trapped in here with you, in an underground outpost far from the light of the sun. Your captors include a cruel Drow Priestess who calls herself <em>Mistress Ilvarra</em> of <strong>House Mizzrym</strong>. Over the past several cycles, you’ve met her several times, robed in silken garments and flanked by two male Drow, one of whom has a mass of scars along one side of his face and neck. <em>Mistress Ilvarra</em> likes to impress her will with scourge in hand and remind you that your life now belongs to her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Welcome to <strong>Velkynvelve</strong>! Accept your fate, learn to obey, and you may survive.” Her words echo in your memory, even as you plot your escape.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of your fellow prisoners do not accept this fate. A stubborn Dwarf refuses to do the pointless work your captors assign, and is summarily thrown over the edge of the platform. He falls a hundred feet into a web and quickly beset upon by Giant Spiders, some blinking into and out of existence.</p>
<p>The last Dwarf in your wretched band of captives is taken up into the smaller of the three Stalagmites, doorways leading to unguessable chambers. A piercing scream, and black mist tinged with red flows out of doorway and various orifices of what is now, clearly, a vile temple of some kind.</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/Velkynvelve.png" alt="Velkynvelve" /></p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Thane <em>Geral</em>!,&quot; greets <em>Sildar</em>, as <em>Geral</em> enters the Townmaster's Hall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two clasp forearms in the Crusader's greeting of fellow soldiers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I have procured the militia to protect <strong>Phandelver Mine</strong>, and this town,&quot; says <em>Geral</em> with a winning smile. &quot;But you're going to have to trust me.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Sister Garaele</em> and <em>Reidoth</em>, a big hulking Druid and friend of <em>Qelline Alderleaf</em> and her son <em>Carp</em> who led the party through the back way into <strong>Tresendar Manor</strong>, stare
impassively at <em>Chiyo</em>. <em>Sildar</em> looks back and forth between the Oni and her husband, a wary expression on his face.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We have the Ward Stone,&quot; says <em>Gruumsh</em> in surprisingly unaccented Common. &quot;We took it from the Vampires we slew at the Cathedral.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Sildar</em> looks at <em>Sister Garaele</em>, who nods minutely. <em>Reidoth's</em> scowl fades.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I had noted their infestation,&quot; he declaims, &quot;but was busy with the Dragon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Icewing</em>?&quot;, asks <em>Gruumsh</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Venomfang</em>&quot;, replies <em>Reidoth</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;A curse upon Dragons!&quot; roars <em>Gruumsh</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Reidoth's</em> craggy face relaxes into a slight smile.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We'll need a Bishop to re-consecrate the Ward stone&quot;, interjects <em>Geral</em> smoothly.</p>
<p>&quot;I will message <strong><a href="journals/../background/neverwinter.html">Neverwinter</a></strong>&quot;, replies <em>Sister Garaele</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;And where will the Clan be housed?&quot;, asks <em>Sildar</em>. &quot;Our farmhouses will not suffice ...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Tresendar Manor</strong>&quot;, replies <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Hmmm.&quot; <em>Sildar</em> looks thoughtful. &quot;That could work.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My people can provide for themselves, but we want to be able to buy the things we cannot make for ourselves, from you,&quot; rumbles <em>Gruumsh</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;That's fair,&quot; notes <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;The <strong>Phandalin Miner's Exchange</strong>,&quot; says <em>Sildar</em>, stroking his chin, &quot;the folk there are more rugged and tolerant.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will send only my most level-headed warriors,&quot; says <em>Gruumsh</em>, &quot;but they will not tolerate disrespect whatever I tell them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Miners are a practical folk,&quot; says <em>Sildar</em>. &quot;We'll keep the Dwarves away for now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;About that,&quot; says <em>Geral</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><strong>Velkynvelve</strong> is three large stalagmites hanging from the roof of a vast cavern. Above, endless skitterings and shriekings announce the presence of huge flocks of flying creatures that somehow nest
in the unseen roof above. Below, endless spiderwebs and the spinners thereof.</p>
<p>In between, the prisoners huddle on a large platform made of some strange-grained wood hung between the inverse towers of <strong>Velkynvelve</strong>. The larger upside-down tower seems to be where <em>Mistress Ilvarra</em>
and her ilk dwell. The mid-sized one appears to be barracks for the Drow soldiers, who number perhaps a score. The smallest one is the accursed temple.</p>
<p>White-furred and savage, Quaggoths move freely amongst the prisoners, feral eyes and teeth gleaming as they appear to consider which of the prisoners would make the tastiest meal. They climb freely around
<strong>Velkynvelve</strong>, seeing to unguessable tasks.</p>
<p>The hours pass slowly. The Drow guards play cruel games with the prisoners, giving them pointless make-work such as coiling and uncoiling large lengths of silken rope, and moving stone ballast from one side of the
platform to the other, laughing when sudden shifts cause everyone to flatten as their tiny world swings from side to side.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Thane <em>Geral</em>!&quot;, greets <em>Gundren</em>, as <em>Geral</em> enters <strong>Phandelver Mine</strong>. &quot;And my old friend <em>Sildar</em>! This is a great hour indeed!&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I bring great news! I have brought the militia that will defend <strong>Phandelver</strong>!&quot; intones <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;That is great news indeed,&quot; says <em>Gundren</em>, urgently. &quot;My scouts have reported a large war-band of Orcs and Ogres in the area.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then let me ease your mind!&quot; replies <em>Geral</em>, a touch too heartily. &quot;They are indeed the militia under my command!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After fifteen minutes or so, <em>Gundren</em> finally runs out of curses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You're going to have to trust me,&quot; says <em>Geral</em>, winningly.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The party has been stripped of all of their gear, and are dressed only in rags.</p>
<p>Speaking in hushed whispers with the other prisoners, in moments snatched from under the watchful glare of the Drow, the party learns the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are slightly more than two dozen Drow in <strong>Velkynvelve</strong>, including <em>Ilvarra</em>, another Priestess <em>Asha</em>, and their lovers <em>Shoor</em> and <em>Jorlan</em>, who are Sorcerers.</li>
<li>The inverted towers each have 3 guards on duty at all times</li>
<li>The main tower has an anti-magic effect, and seems to be where prisoners are processed before being thrown onto the platform</li>
<li>The smaller tower seems to be the barracks for the guards</li>
<li>No prisoner has ever returned from the smallest tower</li>
<li>It might be a matter of cycles before a contingent from <strong>Menzoberranzan</strong> arrives to take the remaining prisoners</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You want to go where?&quot; asks <em>Gundren</em>, disbelievingly.</p>
<p>&quot;The <strong>Underdark</strong>,&quot; replies <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought that's what you said, but I didnae imagine yer had a death wish.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As it happens, you already have a partial portal there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aye, the Fungal Cavern. We were thinkin' a hae to block it off.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, first I'd like you to dig a tunnel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That seems mad, but I know yer want to find yer companions and all. Seems a' hopeless task, dinnae yer ken how big the <strong>Underdark</strong> is?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Trust me,&quot; replies <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;I was afraid a' you'd say thaet.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two cycles later, the Dwarves have dug a 6'x6' shaft straight through the remains of the Fungal Overlord and into the porous rock. It ends on a shelf of granite on the
lip of a vast crevice stretching unimaginably deep.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Here goes nothing,&quot; says <em>Calmul</em>, tossing his finely-wrought, seven-hundred foot length of rope ladder over the edge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Geral</em>, <em>Calmul</em>, <em>Wulrif</em>, and the faithful Steel Guardian take their time climbing down the endless darkness.</p>
<hr />
<p>Disheveled as the rest of the group, but somehow escaping the unwanted attention of the Drow guards and Quaggoths, <em>Steve</em> repeatedly studies the main Stalagmite, a calculating gleam in his eye.</p>
<hr />
<p>The cavern is covered with florescent green lichen, and even <em>Geral</em> and <em>Wulrif</em>'s eyes can appreciate the strange splendor of the <strong>Underdark</strong> as they march its trackless depths.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Hmmm ... it appears that Divination and Alteration magic do not work in this place,&quot; says <em>Wulrif</em> musingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, that's not good. Then again, it's not as if I expected this would be easy,&quot; replies <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p><em>That's not strictly true</em> says a voice in their minds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Geral</em>, <em>Wulrif</em>, and <em>Calmul</em> whirl around, looking for the source. In a distant cavern, a pool of unnatural inky blackness swirls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Do not be alarmed, I mean you no harm.</em></p>
<p>&quot;Have you seen a group of adventurers, perhaps lost?&quot; replies <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p><em>I am aware of a group taken captive by the Drow</em>, the mental voice replies. <em>Mostly Elves, but two smaller folk among them.</em></p>
<p>&quot;Did they look like this?&quot; asks <em>Geral</em>, firmly fixing his memories of <em>Actias</em>, <em>Orky</em>, <em>CoralKing</em>, <em>Benjamin</em>, <em>Steve</em>, <em>Tasbros</em>, <em>Tysnera</em>, and <em>Viker</em> in his mind.</p>
<p><em>Ah yes, those are unusually sharp impressions. I believe that was indeed the group taken.</em></p>
<p><em>They are alive?</em> interjects <em>Wulrif</em>, telepathically.</p>
<p><em>Very good</em> the Voice seems amused. <em>They are alive, for now, but the Drow will doubtless have uses for their ... power.</em></p>
<p>&quot;Do you know where they are?&quot;</p>
<p><em><strong>Velkynvelve</strong>, undoubtedly, for that is where Drow in this area take their prisoners.</em></p>
<p>&quot;How do we get there?&quot;</p>
<p>A mental laugh. <em>You would probably be eaten or lost if you were to attempt to traverse the space locally.</em></p>
<p>&quot;Anything you can do to help direct us, we would appreciate.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Locally?</em> asks <em>Wulrif</em></p>
<p><em>Very good indeed</em>. The mental laugh again. <em>I know of a global shortcut</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;What does that mean?&quot;</p>
<p><em>I can project you to my fellow Society member, who is at this moment surveilling <strong>Velkynvelve</strong>.</em></p>
<p>&quot;What do you ask of us in return?&quot;</p>
<p><em>Only that you convey any information you may gain from the Drow to the Society of Brilliance.</em></p>
<p>&quot;That we will do,&quot; says <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p><em>Indeed, you have so far shown yourself to be a Being of Honor. I will project you to my companion, Skriss. Do not be alarmed at his appearance, he
is un-dangerous to your kind, unless provoked.</em></p>
<p>&quot;You have our thanks. What is your name?&quot;</p>
<p><em>Grazillaxx</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The darkness dissipates, and for a moment they see a tall, mauve figure with horrible tentacles for a face. Then reality fades ...</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/society-of-brilliance.png" alt="The Society of Brilliance" /></p>
<hr />
<p>The hours on the platform drag on.</p>
<p>Her companions conspiring to draw the guards attention, <em>Viker</em> slips over the edge of the platform before shapeshifting into a Giant Spider.</p>
<p>She explores the webbing external to <strong>Velkynvelve</strong>, noting the locations of her fellow spiders as well as the delicious meats guarding the less-delicious meats.</p>
<p>Climbing along the non-sticky threads, something at the edge of the crevasse catches her attention.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Geral</em> can't see much in the darkness, but the fetid stench of the Troglodyte tests his limits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Our thanks, <em>Skriss</em>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A snuffling grunt in reply, then a large scaly reptillian arm points down a particular path. The cavern is so big no one can see its limits. Vast subterranean air currents stir.</p>
<p>The mini-Beholder emits a series of grunts and clicks, then dives into <em>Wulrif's</em> cloak.</p>
<p><em>Geral</em>, <em>Calmul</em>, and <em>Wulrif</em> trudge forward in the darkness, leaning into the swirling wind. A waterfall can be heard somewhere off in the distance, though no water can be seen.</p>
<p>After awhile, dim lighting can be seen ringing what appear to be three inverted towers. Something in the darkness sways.</p>
<p><em>Wulrif</em> coaxes his familiar out.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to look around,&quot; he says, after admonishing the Gazer. &quot;Yes, you be careful.&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>She's nearly at the end of her shapechange time, but something familiar is ahead.</p>
<p><em>Viker?</em> <em>Wulrif's</em> voice echoes in her mind.</p>
<p>Their reunion is joyful, if muted. Reaching nearly the end of her endurance, <em>Calmul</em>, <em>Geral</em>, <em>Viker</em>, and <em>Wulrif</em> devise an escape plan.</p>
<p><em>Viker</em> scuttles back as fast as she can to convey the news.</p>
<hr />
<p>The plan starts with the greatest larceny in <em>Steve's</em> career.</p>
<p>Supremely sneaky, <em>Steve</em> climbs unseen into the largest stalagmite, somehow avoiding the sharp eyes of the Drow. He melts into the shadows of the garrison, gone for a few minutes, everyone intensely not-watching,
before reappearing with a spiderweb satchel of weapons. Somehow he climbs back down without a clink of metal or cry of alarm.</p>
<p>Then he does it again. And again. And again. And again.</p>
<p>When <em>Steve</em> is finished, the party has recovered their precious magic items and most of their wealth. Their mundane items were too numerous and, <em>Steve</em> deemed, too bulky and risky to retrieve.</p>
<p>Stage two starts off with the simultaneous explosion of <em>Viker's</em> Daylight spell and <em>Wulrif's</em> Synaptic Static, both encompassing the guard positions of the middle tower.</p>
<p>As the Drow reel from the twin hammering of light and psychic energy, the party leaps over the edge and onto the non-sticky threads that <em>Viker</em> spun while in Spider form.</p>
<p>The party races down twin tightropes, a thousand feet between them and safety, endless dark below if they fall.</p>
<p><em>Tasbros</em> bobbles and sways dangerously at one point, but somehow regains his balance.</p>
<p>By the time the Drow have recovered and Dispelled Daylight and Synaptic Static, the party has reunited on their end of the cavern.</p>
<p>Not stopping for long, the Irregulars race into the darkness, the Drow pursuit behind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I think we lost them,&quot; says <em>Tysnera</em>, breathlessly.</p>
<p>&quot;We should keep going,&quot; replies <em>CoralKing</em> with no trace of exertion in his voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, that kinda might be a good idea,&quot; says <em>Steve</em>, huffing. &quot;Just let me catch my breath and we can keep going.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is there any particular reason, other than not wanting to be tortured or sacrificed?&quot; asks <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, y'know, the Drow High Priestess? She might be kinda a little upset,&quot; says <em>Steve</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;She seemed pretty upset before,&quot; replies <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, well, I took back our stuff, what belonged to us, y' know? But I <em>stole</em> her Hand Crossbow and Tentacle Rod,&quot; says <em>Steve</em> proudly.</p>

<p>The Tentacle Rod was given to <em>Wulrif</em>.  <em>Benjamin</em> told us there are Fiends near by, within a mile. We continue in a random direction, because we have no idea where we are going. I stumble forward into a cavern of 7 giant Gricks and 10 small ones.</p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> moves up and uses his Staff of Striking and an unarmed strike on the closest small Grick, doing 53 HP damage, slaughtering it!</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> uses his Sunblade twice and his Dancing Sword once.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> does 5 HP damage, killing a small one. Then, he commands his Steel Defender to attack another small one, doing 12 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> attacks a small Grick, doing 22 HP damage, killing it.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> casts Fireball, avoiding Orky. She kills all of the small Gricks, with 30 HP damage each.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> moves through the party to attack some Gricks.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> moves up and shoots one of the Gricks</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> moves up and attacks, doing 14 HP damage killing it. He hits a second one for 10 HP.</li>
<li>A Grick attempts to hit me, but misses. <em>Geral</em> reacts to hit that Grick. Another one hits her for 36 HP damage. They hit <em>Geral</em> for 11 HP damage. One attacks <em>CoralKing</em> for 51HP damage and its tail attacks <em>Geral</em>, missing.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> casts Vitriolic Sphere for 26 damage, doing 13 damage to <em>Geral</em> and Orky. <em>CoralKing</em> gets 0 damage.
<em>Wulrif</em> Hexes and hits a Grick with an Eldritch Blast, doing 37 damage, killing it.</li>
<li>I get my clumsy ass up and cast Thunderous Smite. I attempt to swing my blade, but I'm too dizzy from a mild concussion and miss.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 2</p>
<ol>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> uses 3 unarmed strikes, doing 12 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> hits one for 6 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> uses Branding Smite and misses.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> runs up and stabs a Grick for 24 HP damage, killing it.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> casts Firebolt and does 9 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> uses Healing Word on <em>CoralKing</em>, doing 14 HP healing.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> shoots one of the Gricks and does 23 HP damage, killing it.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> moves toward the last remaining Grick and hits it for 10 HP damage.</li>
<li>It hits back with its tentacles, doing 28 HP damage to <em>Geral</em>.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> casts Chromatic Orb on the remaining Grick, level 1, for 18HP lightning damage and kills it!</li>
</ol>
<p>We explore and scavenge and we find clusters of skulls and bones. In the manure, we find gems and <em>Wulrif</em> cleans them. Thirteen gems worth 500 hp each! <em>Wulrif</em> takes 5, <em>Geral</em> takes 1 and I hand over 4 more to pay for the militia.</p>
<p>A Pearl of Power is also found and given to <em>Tysnera</em>. A Rod of the Pact Keeper +1 is handed over to <em>Wulrif</em>. A Stone of Good Luck is taken by <em>Tasbros</em>. A +1 Light Hammer is found by me.</p>
<h4 id="7000-xp"><a class="header" href="#7000-xp">7,000 XP</a></h4>
<p>We continue along this cavern and discover 4 exit tunnels. <em>Viker</em> turns into a Bat and explores all 4 holes. One of the tunnels she discovers a trail worn with boots and lined with mushrooms. The other 3 look used by animals only and she almost flies into a spiderweb in one! Our tracker investigates the tracks in the trail tunnel and sees they were used by Duergar recently because he finds the bodies. <em>CoralKing</em> grabs their clothing and we follow their trail toward their origin. We decide to go down the trail-looking tunnel after <em>Benjamin</em>. <em>Wulrif</em> puts a Minor Illusion on us so we look like Duergar. A dim light from the mushrooms lights our path until we finally hear water and see a large black lake. <em>Wulrif</em> sees a raft on the shore. All of a sudden, we are attacked by invisible things.</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/barlgura.png" alt="Barlgura" /></p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> swings randomly around him in a panic and doesn’t hit anything.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> holds his action.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> moves a bit and casts Blur on himself.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> holds his action.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> dodges.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> holds her action.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> dodges.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> casts Detect Thoughts.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> casts a Wall of Fire on the right side of our single-file group.</li>
<li>All of a sudden, 3 large money-looking creatures each jump out on either side of us the moment they attack. So, 6 total. I immediately detect them as Fiends. They attack <em>Wulrif</em>, doing 20 HP damage and he gets knocked prone. The 3 that jumped through the Wall of Fire get 9 HP damage each. <em>Tasbros</em> uses luck to avoid getting knocked down but gets hit for 30 HP damage. <em>Calmul</em> gets attacked for 24 damage and knocked down. <em>Tysnera</em> gets attacked next but lifts her shield in time to dodge. I get hit for 6 HP damage.</li>
<li>I cast Protection from Evil.</li>
<li>Viker Summons a Scorpion to fight for us.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> Summons a Shadowspawn to fight for us.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 2</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> wants to know their weakness.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> uses his crossbow to hit one of the monkey-Fiends.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> uses his Hexblade to Curse one of the middle monkey-Fiends. He does 29 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> stands up, casts Branding Smite, and hits with 15 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> moves forward, uses Commander's Strike on me to hit it and I do 16 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> uses her Scorpion to attack the weakest monkey-Fiend.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> uses one unarmed strike and one Stunning Strike for 18 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> stands up and spends 6 spell points to cast Polymorph to turn himself into a Giant Ape. He punches the attacking monkey-Fiend in the face, doing 17 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> casts Haste on <em>Wulrif</em>.</li>
<li>A monkey-Fiend attacks <em>Wulrif</em> for 14 HP damage. Another attacks <em>Tysnera</em> and <em>Geral</em> reacts by hitting it and actually kills it. Another one attacks <em>CoralKing</em> for 12 HP damage. I get hit for 7 HP damage.</li>
<li>I cast Thunderous Smite and hit a Troll for 23 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> casts Evard's Black Tentacles that entangles all of the Trolls for damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 3</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> does 16 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> hits the monkey-Fiend <em>Wulrif</em> was fighting for 8 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> uses the Bonus Action of the Dancing Blade to do 19HP damage. His Sunblade does 28 HP damage. He also does 11 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> does something?</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> uses Commander's Strike on me to hit one of them for 10 damage. <em>Geral</em> hits one too.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> Teleports and hits one of the monkey-Fiends, killing it. It's remains disperse in a stinky cloud. Her scorpion does enough damage to evaporate another one.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> moves just out of the way of Evard's Black Tentacles to attack one of the 3 remaining Trolls. He does 16 HP damage on each of 2 hits.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> gets up, turns around and smacks a Troll, killing it hard.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> kills one with 63 HP damage of Cloudkill. This prevents literally anyone but our enemies from seeing.</li>
<li>The Shadowspawn hits one of the remaining Trolls.</li>
<li>The entangled one gets out of the tentacles, still taking 13 HP damage on the way, and moves toward <em>Wulrif</em>. It attacks him and knocks him down, doing 20 HP damage.</li>
<li>The other one attacks <em>Actias</em> twice and gets 5 HP damage.</li>
<li>I hit one of the trolls for some 27 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> holds her action</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 4</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> moves his Bane onto another Troll and shoots it.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> hits one for 22 HP damage, killing it!</li>
</ol>
<p>We draw our attention back to the strange raft by the lake. We notice it has some kind of device on it's side that trails into the water.</p>

<p>We're beside an underground lake of unknown size. Those of us with armor will sink and drown if we end up into the water. The raft is not big enough for all of us. It’s big enough for 3 people and has some sort of mechanism on the back of it that <em>Calmul</em> decides is a Motor. We decide to just walk along the shore to the right. Eventually we are stopped by a wall and the water runs underneath it. So, we turn around and hit a wall over time too. <em>Viker</em> decides to transform into a Bat and fly ahead to scout a way out. She flies for an hour and finds nothing. She turns left and loops around. Somehow she flies into something and gets stuck and can feel the substance moving. She transforms into a Spider and sees a Spider moving down toward her. Then, she realizes it’s trying to mate with her. She accepts the packet it offers her and it scurries away. Now she has a moment to herself and senses an entire web-way in this cavern. She transforms back into a Bat and reports to the shore.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <em>Wulrif</em> inspects the land and finds a bunch of mushrooms 30-40 ft tall that are kind of like wood. He figures out that these are what the raft is made out of.</p>
<p>Also, <em>Tasbros</em> electrifies the water and a cooked fish flies out. Then, a bunch of butterflies and petals appear around him and flutter away.</p>
<p><em>Viker</em> inspects the opposite side of the lake and finds more water, an hour out. She can’t even detect the ceiling. She catches bugs and doesn’t recognize them. They are very tasty though. She finds a plant on a stalactite and brings it back to <em>Wulrif</em> to investigate.</p>
<p>We tell <em>Viker</em> about the woody mushrooms and all agree to build a bigger raft. So, <em>Actias</em> uses his Sunsword to start chopping them down. We all fashion the cuttings to the smaller raft and <em>Calmul</em> thinks he can use the Motor to propel the whole raft.</p>
<p>So, we set out on our new raft and Motor.</p>
<p>Half a cycle of traveling much faster than we can row, everyone except <em>Calmul</em> sees 6 large fins circle us. They move around languidly until they are approximately 10 feet away.</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/giant-sharks-darklake.png" alt="Giant Sharks" /></p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> uses Patient Defense to Dodge, then holds his action.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> Quickens his Witch Bolt and casts Eldritch Blast to hit one of the creatures, doing 54 HP damage. It twitches and the other fins get really excited.</li>
<li>I cast Protection from Evil on myself.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> hides and Dodges.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> casts Call Lightning and blasts the fin that <em>Wulrif</em> attacks, doing 24 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> uses Hail of Thorns to shoot the fin that <em>Wulrif</em> attacked.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> uses his Dancing Sword and casts Eldritch Blast, doing 16 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> holds her action.</li>
<li>The first fin approaches and knocks the raft over. Me, <em>Benjamin</em>, <em>Steve</em>, and <em>CoralKing</em> are the only ones who remained on the raft. <em>Tasbros</em> is swimming and the second fin misses him while the third one bites him, doing 22 HP damage. <em>Wulrif</em> is attacked by the fourth fin and it hits him for 31 HP damage. <em>Actias</em> gets bitten and uses Hellish Rebuke, doing 13 HP damage. <em>Tasbros</em> uses Haste on <em>Wulrif</em>. <em>Tysnera</em> is sinking ...</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 2</p>
<ol>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> pulls <em>Tysnera</em> back into the raft.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> forks his Witch Bolt and kills the injured fin, also hitting a second one. Then he jumps off the raft and turns into a Giant Shark.</li>
<li>I take a Vow of Enmity, cast Wrathful Smite, and swing at the fin closest to me, doing a total of 35 HP damage. It is also frightened of me.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> tries not to look like a Halfling snack.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> Teleports back onto the raft and uses Call Lightning on another Giant Shark.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> finds their weaknesses are nonexistent. They are not resistant or immune to anything either. They are Beasts.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> uses Thunder Step to transport out of the water and back onto the raft.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> is prone and casts Banishment on 2 of the sharks who haven’t been damaged. She succeeds!</li>
<li>The frightened Shark attacks <em>Tasbros</em> for 24 HP damage. 2 Sharks hit <em>Wulrif</em> (Sharkeisha) and do 50 HP damage!</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> uses Lightning Lure.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 3</p>
<ol>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> pulls <em>Tasbros</em> onto the raft, prone.</li>
<li>Sharkeisha attacks the Sharks in front of him and does 24 HP damage.</li>
<li>I move to the opposite corner of the raft to swing at a fin, doing 39 damage.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> shoots the Shark Orky just hit, doing 29 damage.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> heals Sharkeisha for 2 HP.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> Banes both of the remaining Sharks.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> uses Magic Missile and kills the weakened Shark.</li>
<li>A Shark attacks Sharkeisha for 13 damage.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> uses Lightning Lure and does 25 HP damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 4</p>
<ol>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> uses Walk on Water, does 20 damage to a Shark, then Teleports back.</li>
<li>Sharkeisha does 30 ish HP damage.</li>
<li>I cast cure wounds for 6 HP of healing on Sharkeisha.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> uses Call Lightning and kills it!</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> cures Sharkeisha for a few HP.</li>
</ol>
<p>We decide to keep traveling forward to get away from the banished Sharks eventual return. We encounter an island with some fungi and take a long rest!</p>
<p><em>Wulrif</em> Detects Thoughts on the island and finds nothing. <em>Tysnera</em> tries Detect Magic and gets nothing, too.</p>

<h4 id="from-the-journal-of-dame-orky-12"><a class="header" href="#from-the-journal-of-dame-orky-12">From the journal of Dame Orky</a></h4>
<p><em>Wulrif</em> nearly dies when he reverts back to his normal form. I use Lay On Hands to give him 50 HP and bring him back to consciousness. Then, we all take a long rest.</p>
<p>We discovered an island with mushrooms on it. It seems steep, maybe the top of a stalagmite. I look around to see if we’re safe. I notice some strange but small things rustling around in the mushrooms. The mushrooms are around 60 feet high.</p>
<p>We hear music and singing in a hauntingly beautiful soprano. We see an inverted mushroom cap and a Half-Elven woman holding a lute and playing. <em>Geral</em> goes to the shore nearest her craft.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Hello, do we know you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I don't think so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you know where we are?”</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Darklake</strong>, eastern shore, probably near <strong>Sloobludop</strong>, though the currents make it hard to tell”.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you hear that rustling?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Could be bats, Stirges -- hopefully not Ixitxachitl.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are -- what you just said?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fiendish little bloodsuckers, look like small manta rays with fangs and poison-barbed tails.&quot; She shudders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Calmul</em> looks around wildly for something to hide under. Seeing nothing of use, a cloud of clockwork machines begin constructing a tent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Can you guide us out of here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am <em>Geral</em> and this is <em>Orky</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pleased to make your acquaintance! I am <em>Avren</em>, a Bard by avocation.&quot; She makes an elaborate, graceful bow without falling out of her craft. &quot;I collect lore and knowledge from the <strong>Underdark</strong>. You look lost.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are indeed, and seeking a way out of here. How did you get here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A waterfall deep in the <strong>Neverwinter Wood</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; says <em>Geral</em>, disappointed. &quot;I suppose you don't go back the same way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; <em>Avren</em> replies with a tinkling laugh. &quot;I normally meet someone friendly, trade with them, and take one of the trails out, usually through <strong>Gracklstugh</strong>. That's about 8-10 cycles from here, as the raft wanders.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who lives in <strong>Gracklstugh</strong>?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Duergar, Deep Gnomes, and Mountain Dwarves. Stay away from <em>Themberchaud's</em> Lair and <strong>The Keepers of the Flame</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Themberchaud</em>?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Wyrmsmith of <strong>Gracklstugh</strong>. An ancient Red Dragon of unlimited appetite, though <strong>The Keepers of the Flame</strong> know how to satiate him,&quot; <em>Avren</em> says darkly.</p>
<p>&quot;How do you find your way?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, sometimes you can be friendly with the Kuo-toa, as long as you don't look like an easy victim. They are a bit mad, but know how to navigate <strong>Darklake</strong>, and they enjoy my music. They live in <strong>Sloobludop</strong>, and worship the Sea Mother.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Avren</em> is full of useful information about the mushrooms of the <strong>Underdark</strong>, telling us which ones make water, wine, food, and other things.</p>
<p>We remember that we are here to hunt Fiends for the <em>Society of Brilliance</em> and discover how they are getting into the <strong>Underdark</strong>. We decide to take a cycle and fashion some more secure rafts. That cycle goes well! The team makes food and water from the mushrooms. <em>Avren</em> points out some mushrooms with orange and red stripes and says they are called “The Devil’s Mushrooms”, making a really strong red liquor that the Duergar like. <em>Calmul</em> busts out a still in a cloud of small, whirring, magical devices. No one is brave enough to drink the final product. We end up with 2 wine skins of the stuff, which <em>Avren</em> says will be worth a lot in <strong>Gracklstugh</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Benjamin</em> decides to explore and finds 3 octopodes in the tops of the tree-like mushrooms <em>Avren</em> calls Zurkhwood. One of them floats off ... in fear? Another is chewing on a Stirge. I like that one. <em>Steve</em> attempts to catch it and but somehow it detects ultra-sneaky <em>Steve</em> and escapes. Now, all 3 are gone.</p>
<p>These are the occupants of the rafts:</p>
<p>Canoe 1 (2 people) - <em>Steve</em> and <em>Benjamin</em></p>
<p>Canoe 2 (2 people) - <em>Tysnera</em> and <em>Viker</em></p>
<p>Raft (10 people) - Me right in the middle, <em>Calmul</em> + Steel Defender, <em>CoralKing</em>, <strong>Tasbros</strong>, <em>Geral</em>, <em>Actias</em>, and <em>Wulrif</em>.</p>
<p><em>Avren’s</em> Mushroom (1 person) - <em>Avren</em></p>
<p><em>Viker</em> decides to morph into a Shark to tow the rafts. She takes off at 35 MPH, knocking us over. <em>Tysnera</em> falls out of the raft. <em>Geral</em> cuts the rope from <em>Viker</em>, while <em>Wulrif</em> telepathically tells <em>Viker</em> that we lost <em>Tysnera</em>. After 10 minutes, <em>Tysnera</em> is back in her raft. We work out a way to tell <em>Viker</em> if things go wrong. She takes off again. We are really moving!</p>
<p>Sometime later, <em>Viker</em> smells prey, tainted with Fiendish overtones. Suddenly, large and small fishy-scaly things swarm our rafts!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Kuo-toa, not the friendly kind!&quot; <em>Avren</em> shouts.</p>
<p>&quot;What are the big Uglies?&quot; <em>Geral</em> asks.</p>
<p>&quot;Merrow! Servants of the <em>Deep Father</em>!&quot; <em>Avren</em> replies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="journals/images/darklake-raft-battle.png" alt="Darklake Raft Battle" /></p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> uses Hunter's Sense on the Merrow. They are Monstrosities tainted by Fiends, and have no weaknesses. Worse, they are immune to being Charmed or Frightened.</li>

<li><em>CoralKing</em> uses 2 unarmed strikes and 1 hit (AC 15) for 7 HP on another Merrow swarming the Raft.</li>

<li>A Kuo-toa throws a net over <em>Geral</em> but <em>Tysnera</em> uses Protective Wings as a reaction to cause the net to miss. Another attempts to throw a net over <em>Calmul’s</em> Steel Defender. The last one nets <em>Avren</em> and she is now restrained. I get hit by a Hold Person spell and become paralyzed.</li>
<li><em>Avren</em> throws the net off of her.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> gets attacked by a Kuo-toa with a Mancatcher polearm and is grappled.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> casts Banishment on 2 of the Merrow and they disappear.</li>

<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> uses his Longbow to shoot some of the Kuo-toa. He does 23 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> casts Blindness and Deafness on a Merrow but it fails.</li>

<li><em>Viker</em> is still grappled, but does 20 HP damage to the Kuo-toa Archpriest she's chewing on.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> is netted by a Kuo-toa.</li>
<li>The Kuo-toa Archpriest casts Mass Cure Wounds on all the creatures we damaged?!?</li>
<li><em>Avren</em> casts Thunder Wave and hits 3 Kuo-toa (including the Archpriest), doing 18 damage to them and driving them away.</li>
<li>A Kuo-toa attempts to net <em>Tysnera</em>, but <em>Geral</em> hamstrings it with an attack of opportunity as it tries to get past him, sticking it in place. Yay!</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> casts Fireball and does 37 HP damage to a Merrow and bunch of Kuo-toa. Yay!</li>
<li>The Kuo-toa with <em>Tasbros</em> stuck in it's polearm pulls him underwater. Boo!</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 3</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> shoots the Merrow in the head and does 22 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> doesn't escape and didn't get a chance to hold his breath, so he is starting to drown.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> moves to the back of the raft and attacks one of the Merrow with his Staff of Striking, doing 25 HP damage. He also uses Flurry of Blows for 8 HP more damage.</li>
<li>I move to the nearest Kuo-toa with a Mancatcher and attack it twice, doing 33 HP damage, killing it.</li>

<li><em>Viker</em> wriggles out of the Merrow's harpoon and does some more damage chewing on the Archpriest.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> gets tangled in a net. Another Kuo-toa swims toward <em>Avren</em> and attacks her.</li>
<li><em>Avren</em> stabs it with her rapier for 17 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> casts Magic Missile at the Merrow, doing 12 damage. That kills it!</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 4</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> shoots the Kuo-toa Archpriest and does some damage.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> is still being held underwater by the Kuo-toa with the Mancatcher pole-arm and drowning.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> attacks a Kuo-toa with some unarmed strikes and does 14 damage.</li>
<li>I cast Haste on <em>CoralKing</em> and he attacks the Kuo-toa again, doing 11 HP damage, killing it!</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> hits the Kuo-toa in front of him doing 10 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> Sneak Attacks the Kuo-toa in front of <em>Geral</em>, doing 56 HP damage, obliterating it!</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> shoots the 2 Kuo-toa attacking <em>Avren</em>, doing 7 HP damage on one and 13 on the Archpriest.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> is no longer entangled and spits out the Archpriest to attack the Kuo-toa holding <em>Tasbros</em> underwater. BIG CHOMP! And <em>Tasbros</em> is saved!</li>
<li>The Archpriests that <em>Viker</em> was chewing on and attacking <em>Avren</em> decide to skedaddle.</li>
<li><em>Avren</em> holds her action.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> holds her action.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> bursts to the surface, <em>Viker</em> eats the Kuo-toa and comes back to the surface to tow us away quickly before the banished Merrow pop back. This gives us enough time to take a short rest.</li>
</ol>
<p>We keep going along and we see more Kuo-toa. They start swimming parallel to us, hailing us in Undercommon, which <em>CoralKing</em> and <em>Avren</em> understand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Why did your people attack us?&quot; asks <em>CoralKing</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;That was not us! Those were blasphemers who follow the <em>Deep Father</em>!&quot; replies the Kuo-toa.</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; asks <em>CoralKing</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;I am <em>Ploopploopeen</em>, Archpriest of <em>Blibdoolpoolp</em>. We are the true followers of the <em>Sea Mother</em> and we will reward you if you help us fight these blasphemers. You look like you are trying to get up to the surface. We can help you get there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ask them why they want our help,&quot; says <em>Viker</em>. <em>CoralKing</em> translates.</p>
<p>&quot;We are the defenders of our faith,&quot; replies <em>Ploopploopeen</em>. &quot;Long have the inhabitants of <strong>Sloobludop</strong> lived in harmonious service to the will of the <em>Sea Mother</em>. But recently, my own daughter <em>Bloppblippodd</em> experienced a powerful vision of
<em>Leemooggoogoon</em> the <em>Deep Father</em>, proclaiming him our new god. Her power has increased greatly, and many of our people have been swayed to her cause. We are split in two, fighting among ourselves. The followers of the <em>Deep Father</em> have been
making an increasing number of offerings on his Altar -- sacrificing and then casting bloody chum into the waters of the <strong>Darklake</strong>, where it is consumed by ... something.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>CoralKing</em> gets the sense that they are telling the truth, but he can’t read their unblinking eyes and fishy expressions too well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What do we get for helping you?&quot; asks <em>CoralKing</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;We can show you the way to <strong>Gracklstugh</strong> by safe paths.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is your plan?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We will pretend to offer you to the followers of the <em>Deep Father</em> as a sacrifice, to mend our breach. Then, when you are at their Altar, we will attack.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?!&quot; says <em>Viker</em>, when <em>CoralKing</em> translates. <em>Geral</em> minutely shakes his head.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not give up our weapons,&quot; says <em>CoralKing</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;They will not care. They believe the <em>Deep Father</em> is irresistible. They will not expect you to fight back.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Wulrif</em> doesn’t trust our companions, so he uses magic to read their minds. As best as he can tell, they are telling the truth. <em>Geral</em> uses <em>Avren</em> to see if there is any natural substance she knows of that we can use to protect ourselves from the psychological awe-generation powers used by the Deep Father (<em>Leemooggoogoon</em>). The creatures we are following said they worship the Sea Mother to protect themselves. They said she values regurgitation of goods as the highest gift we can offer to her. The creatures mention <em>Blibdoolpoolp</em> has the form of a human female with the head and claws of a lobster.</p>
<p>We see the cavern change shapes as we move through it. We see fluorescent patches very high in the cave and also floating on the water. We approach <strong>Sloobludop</strong> via docks and we can see the shrine of the Sea Mother. The Kuo-toa get out of the water and start chanting. <em>Geral</em> leads our crew and we follow onto the land, single-file, surrounded on all sides by Kuo-toa.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A nine-foot-tall statue stands here. Its body is roughly carved from some kind of wood in the shape of a humanoid female, its head and forearms formed from the severed head and claws of a giant albino crayfish. These parts are lashed on with strands of gut, and emit an overpowering stench of rotting shellfish. Shells, brightly colored stones, mushrooms, and rotting fish are piled at the statue’s feet and strung in garlands around its neck. Four stern Kuo-toa slowly circle the statue, alert and on guard, while a few others mill about, gazing up at the statue and bowing repeatedly while chanting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Ploopploopeen</em> invites us into his hovel and screams something to the other Kuo-toa. <em>CoralKing</em> translates to us that he is explaining not to injure his guests and explains why we are there. He tells us that someone will be here soon to accept us. <em>Geral</em> offers his original sword as a gift to the statue. She accepts it. <em>Wulrif</em> gives up his tentacle rod and she accepts it. <em>Actias</em> regurgitated a ruby he consumed and it was accepted. <em>CoralKing</em> has nothing to offer, but he demonstrates a respectful backflip, and immediately vomits. The crowd stirs uncomfortably, showing his offering was not accepted.</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/ooa03-04.png" alt="Shrine of the Deep Father" /></p>
<p>We are escorted to the altar of the Deep Father.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idol to <em>Leemooggoogoon</em> the Deep Father consists of a large hide cut roughly in the shape of a manta ray and stretched out on cords between two support poles. A dead, splayed-out manta ray is pinned to the center of the hide. Two dead octopuses are draped across the top, their tentacles pinned and artfully arrayed, their heads tied together and painted with red and blue pigments. The idol reeks of decay, and the broad stone altar below the idol is stained dark with blood.</p>
<p>The archpriest of the Sea Mother steps forward across the span of the altar toward the Kuo-toa waiting for him there. “The time has come,” he says, “for us to acknowledge your divine vision and welcome it. I have brought these as offerings.” He gestures toward all of you, standing within a circle of guards behind him. “Will you not accept them?” “You are wise, father,” the younger archpriest replies. “I accept your offering in the name of the Deep Father. May their blood nourish and strengthen him!” A burbling cheer goes up from the surrounding Kuo-toa, their fists raised in the air.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They carry in this Duergar who we can tell is about to be sacrificed and I start to feel furious. I don’t have anything to help him though. Just when I can see <em>Geral</em> is about to step in, while <em>Bloppblippodd</em> hovers a dagger above the Duergar's heart, <em>Ploopploopeen</em> strikes her!</p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/session-21-round-1.png" alt="Round 1" /></p>
<ol>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> is readying his action so that once 3 people in our group attacks, he will take his action.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> readies his action until someone attacks our group. After he is attacked, he infuses my sword with 1d4 lightning damage.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> suddenly Polymorphs into a Tyrannosaurus Rex, throwing everyone back. He then bites at the high priestess, but misses. He swipes his tail and hits a Kuo-toa, doing 17 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Avren</em> casts greater invisibility and bardic inspiration, going invisible.</li>
<li>The high priestess casts a spell and a bunch of spirit creatures appear, doing necrotic 17 HP damage to <em>Wulrif</em>, <em>Geral</em>, and <em>Avren</em>. <em>Geral</em> only gets half damage though. <em>Ploopploopeen</em> attacks his daughter again but misses. A couple of Kuo-toa attack <em>Wulrif</em>. The high priestess casts magical weapons that do 13 HP damage and 27 HP damage. <em>CoralKing</em> uses Shadow Step on a priest and does 33 HP damage.</li>
<li>I cast Crusader’s Mantle and make a Vow of Enmity on the high priestess.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> sneaks to the back of the line and attacks a priest, doing 28 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> summons a scorpion and it attacks the priest that <em>Steve</em> attacked earlier. She does 27 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> casts thunderous step and hits 6 Kuo-toa.</li>
<li>Benjamin tried to rush past the Kuo-toa, but failed</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> pushes the priestess with his shield, and pushes the sacrifice as far away as he can.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 2</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/session-21-round-2.png" alt="Round 2" /></p>
<ol>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> hits the priest twice with his staff, doing 42 HP total damage. I start to see how powerful <em>CoralKing</em> can be! He is impressive!</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> casts a spell and flies 40 feet up.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> bites the priestess and does 49 HP damage to her. He whips his tail and misses another Kuo-toa.</li>
<li><em>Avren</em> moves toward the priestess and stabs her with her rapier and does 7 HP damage to her.</li>
<li>The priestess damages <em>Geral</em>, <em>Wulrif</em>, <em>Avren</em>, from her ongoing spell and escapes from her grapple. Her father attacks her and a priest casts Mass Cure Wounds, making every enemy heal 25 HP. <em>Steve</em> gets paralyzed. All of a sudden a bunch of Kuo-toa start attacking each other. The ones doing the attacking seem to be moving out of our way to attack the others. So, I think we can suspect which ones are on our side now.</li>
<li><em>Ploopploopeen</em> casts Mass Cure Wounds, healing 15 HP on every friend.</li>
<li>I move next to the priestess and hit her twice with my great sword, doing 32 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> Misty Steps next to her and attacks her with his Sunblade, doing 31 HP damage, killing that awful woman.</li>
<li>Benjamin moves and finds the weaknesses of the Kuo-toa, the priests can see invisible things. They are slippery and escapes grapples. They are vulnerable to sunlight. Their shields are also sticky and if you swing on them, striking them with your weapon, it stays in the shield.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Another sound rises above the burbling cries of the Kuo-toa. The dark surface of the water farther out bubbles and begins to foam. A thick, oily tentacle bursts forth, followed by another. Then two monstrous heads break the surface, both resembling hideous, angry baboons with wickedly curved tusks. Both heads are attached to a single torso, and the monster’s red eyes burn with bloodlust and madness. The creature rising from the Darklake must stand thirty feet tall or more, with water cascading down its back and shoulders. Upon reaching its full height, the great demon throws back both its heads and roars!</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 -->
<ol start="10">
<li>We realize that we accidentally sacrificed the priestess as most of the Kuo-toa fall to the ground in awe. The ones who gifted the Sea goddess -- <em>Geral</em>, <em>Wulrif</em>, and <em>Actias</em> -- all instinctively know to avert their gaze. Everyone else miraculously survives the Gaze attack.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> screams at all of us to <strong>Run!</strong> We see a bunch of Merrow appear next to the giant creature. They look like the ones that attacked us on the rafts.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> recognizes this as <em>Demogorgon</em>, and he yells telepathically that this is a Demon Prince and we need to leave immediately! Our group and the allied Kuo-toa run away. <em>Viker</em>’s scorpion is Beguiled and attacks some of the Kuo-toa running by.</li>
<li>The Hold Person on <em>Steve</em> drops and he jumps on <em>Wulrif</em>’s back when he runs by.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> turns into a bat and flies above the T-Rex.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> drops Polymorph to Dimension Door himself, <em>Geral</em>, <em>Steve</em>, and the Duergar away.</li>
<li>We all flee. I grab a Kuo-toa sticky shield as I run.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="journals/images/ooa03-05.png" alt="Demogorgon" /></p>
<p>A Kuo-toa opens a marshy passage out of <strong>Sloobludop</strong> and we all run through. We hear immense destruction behind us as we struggle through the swamp. <em>Avren</em> Polymorphs into an Owlbear and tosses <em>Actias</em> onto her back as she runs.</p>
<p>Much later, the Duergar thanks us and introduces himself as <em>Hemeth</em>. He tells us he can get us passage into <strong>Gracklstugh</strong>. <em>CoralKing</em> uses Insight to see if this guy is telling the truth. He seems genuinely grateful and helpful.</p>

<p>We are in the swamp listening to <strong>Sloobludop</strong>’s destruction; we no longer have it within our sight. The Duergar, <em>Hemeth</em>, asks us if we can get out of here and we all enthusiastically agree. The Duergar settlement is called <strong>Gracklstugh</strong>.  He said they will arrest us for being foreigners if we enter through the gates. He suggests we try the lake shore. It should take us an hour. <em>Geral</em> asks what we need to know about <em>Hemeth</em>’s people. They don’t trust most people. They said they follow the laws absolutely and always keep their word, when most don’t. He said they will trade with Drow if they follow the rules. <em>Geral</em> asks if there are rules we need to be aware of.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't assault the Stone Guards.</li>
<li>Everyone is responsible for their own actions.</li>
<li>Starting a fight is illegal.</li>
<li>Stay in the <strong>Darklake District</strong>.</li>
<li>Execution is the punishment for breaking the rules.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Geral</em> asks if they have libraries with texts. <em>Hemeth</em> responds “not to outsiders”.</p>
<p>We make it to the river and there is a pile of cattails and reeds. The koa-tao dive underwater and return with 4 mushroom rafts. They exclaim for us to wait while something big in the water passes by. Then, they clear us to enter the rafts again.</p>
<p>I am heavy with my armor, so <em>CoralKing</em> and some Koa-toa get put with me in 1 raft.
<em>Avren</em>, <em>Benjamin</em>, and <em>Calmul</em> are in another one.
<em>Tysnera</em>, <em>Tasbros</em>, and <em>Viker</em> in the next.
<em>Geral</em>, <em>Hemeth</em>, <em>Steve</em> and <em>Calmul</em>’s steel defender in the last one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After hours of tense navigation, you glimpse an orange glow in the distance. Soon you hear faint metallic echoes, growing louder as you come closer.</p>
<p>Firelight illuminates massive columns with structures built around their bases. The cold air of the <strong>Underdark</strong> is becoming warmer even at this distance, and you can now see a variety of piers made from zurkhwood, stone, and plain rock jutting out along the edge of a huge cavern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We thank <em>Hemeth</em> for his help. He returns <em>Geral</em>’s axe and returns thanks, saying we could do business in the future, as the town blacksmith.</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/ooa04-03.png" alt="Darklake District" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A wave of heat slams against you as an acrid smog rises to choke the air out of your lungs. The Darklake spreads out beyond a jumble of buildings and streets, reflecting the lights of countless fires burning across the city within hollowed-out columns and stalagmites.</p>
<p>Though the streets are crowded, you move easily within the surging throng of buyers, merchants, and slaves. You aren’t the only outsiders here, as you spy Drow, Svirfneblin, Derro, Orcs, and other races in the crowds. The shouting of people blends with the sound of distant hammering to create a constant, distracting din.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We make our way to the nearest bazaar and everyone in our group loads up on basic necessities. As we finish up our shopping, a giant two-headed gray monster approaches the city, bursting through the gates and attacks the citizens.</p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li>The giant attacks me twice with his club, doing 34 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> finds the weaknesses of this giant. He is normally a stone giant, but the second deformed head means something else. They are stealthy but no resistances. He also casts Hunter’s Mark on it.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> said “whatever, I cast Magic Missile, I don’t care!” She casts 5, so 15 missiles hit the giant, doing 12 HP total.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> uses Shadow Step to move opposite me, near the giant. He hits him twice with the staff and gets double damage on one hit. He does 35 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> does 10 HP damage on a hit and asks me to hit, which I do 27 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> shoots his musket, doing 20 HP damage. His steel defender misses.</li>
<li><em>Avren</em> shoots her brand new bow</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> casts a gem Dragon spirit, which makes 2 attacks and 15 HP damage.</li>
<li>The giant’s mutated head swells up with bloodlust and attacks me, <em>Geral</em> reacts and hits him for 10 HP damage. I lose 35 HP on the first hit and 18 HP on the second hit.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> sneak attacks and hits for 35 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> heals me for 18 HP.</li>
<li>I cast Crusader’s Mantle.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 2</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> shoots the giant mutated face for 13 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> attempts to banish him but fails. She feels like he should have been banished, but something kept him here.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> hits the giant with his Staff of Striking twice and it does nothing. He looks very confused, since it worked the first time.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> tries to hit him with his magic sword and it does 18 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> shoots the giant twice with his musket and they miss. His steel defender does 5 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Avren</em> shoots him with her bow, but it bounces off and does no damage.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> uses a fire-adept spell and takes half damage, 14 HP. He uses Chromatic Orb? and does 13 HP damage.</li>
<li>The giant seems to heal, turn around, and hits <em>Tasbros</em>’ giant twice. <em>Geral</em> uses an opportunity attack for 12 HP damage. I do the same and do 29 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> does 31 HP damage and the giant dramatically falls to the ground, shaking the earth? Underterra.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another giant, who looks normal, comes up to look at the body and sighs. More of the huge Duergar appear from the market and talk to the giant. Via <em>CoralKing</em>, we learn that they discuss us killing his rogue kind. The giant requests he drag the body back to his home. The giant tells us in Common for saving society from worse damage. <em>CoralKing</em> asks why he attacked us. He said he was convening with “the stone”, grew 2 heads, went mad, and ran away. He said if he had only been knocked unconscious, we might have been able to find out what was wrong with him. We all look at each other like “Oops”, while the body is dragged away.</p>
<p>In Common, the Duergar Stone Guard tell us they would like a word with us. We all put our weapons away, while <em>Tasbros</em> hesitates. 3 Stone Guards surround him in suspicion. They tell <em>Geral</em> to ask <em>Tasbros</em> to stand down before he is executed. <em>Geral</em> and <em>Tasbros</em> comply. <em>Geral</em> explains that we are trying to find our way back to the surface. The Stone Guard command us to go with them. We comply. They march us into a fortress and <em>Calmul</em> recognizes Cannons on the battlements. <em>Benjamin</em> knows Duergar can enlarge to giant size and turn invisible. So, he knows that there are probably more Duergar around us that we don’t see. They can also see other invisible entities.</p>
<p>They lead us into the dungeon, and we all get a long rest, while we all say “WTF?!?” We are finally taken to a dark office and meet with a large female Duergar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After waiting a long while in a dungeon cell carved out of impressively thick stone, you are taken to a dark office and met by an imposing female gray Dwarf. She is fully armored and bears an insignia you have not seen on any other Duergar. She is flanked by two Stone Guards who remain by the door.</p>
<p>“I am Captain <em>Errde Blackskull</em>, Commander of the Stone Guard,” she says, giving each of you a calculating look. “Let me start by saying you are worth nothing here in Gracklstugh. Most of those in my command would sell you off in a heartbeat as the cheapest manual labor. However, I’ve learned to make much better use of adventurers like you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ask what she is going to do with us. She said we have a few options. She can just let us go, or ask for our help tracking a thief, <em>Droki</em>, a Derro. She advises us not to go to a strange location, debasing ourselves. She also requests us to find the source of corruption and report back to her. She said she will give us maps to <strong>Blingdenstone</strong>, a friendly Deep Gnome colony if we keep our side of the bargain. If not, she will sell us to slavery. She tells us that Derro are degenerate, insane, some of whom are useful and stay in dark lake. They are more magic resistant, but not the same abilities. They only move in packs, because they are weak in packs. <em>Droki</em> has been able to sneak in and out of town, stealing secrets, and they have no idea how, since he is operating alone. She said she will outfit us with gear to complete our mission.</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/ooa04-05.png" alt="Droki" /></p>
<p>Awhile later, a Stone Guard presents us with gold badges and said if we present these to the other Stone Guard, he will let us pass. He also said a group of Drow are asking for a large party, fitting our description. <em>Droki</em> is a spy for the Council of Savants, which are an evil rebel group. We are outfitted and take our badges. We are escorted out of the fortress as <em>Calmul</em> notices more cannons and the guard are carrying pistols with 7 barrels.</p>
<p>We are now in the <strong>Darklake District</strong> and <em>Geral</em> suggests we start at a common area. <strong><strong>Gholbrorn's Lair</strong></strong> is the tavern that outsiders can stay in. It’s underneath the docks as we were told. We head there and find a cave system, with a tavern standing on 4 pylons.</p>
<p>As we enter, <em>Avren</em> attempts to listen about <em>Droki</em> and all she hears about how dangerous the <strong>Underdark</strong> has become. Even the animals and flora seem agitated about a change in the air. Isolated settlements have been attacked by demons. <em>Tysnera</em> approaches the inn keeper and asks about <em>Droki</em>, a Derro. He said he hasn’t seen any Derro nearby and they usually attack outsiders like us. <em>Avren</em> casts detects thoughts and she senses most people are grateful that they made it here. They had a tough journey here and some want to go further but aren’t sure they will make it safely. Suddenly, 2 Orcs jump up and attack each other. We watch in horror as they are separated and they seem to be confused as to why they were fighting in the first place.</p>
<p>I assist <em>Tasbros</em> in a religious sense to find that several demon lords could cause this type of madness. We are far from where it happened last, but we have seen this phenomena twice now. 1 wouldn’t be sufficient to cause this wide-spread issue. One called the Maze Lord, which thrives in environments that are maze-like such as the <strong>Underdark</strong>, is known of.</p>
<p>We decide to head East, into the slums of <strong>Gracklstugh</strong>, where the Derro live. <em>Avren</em> changes her into a Derro and uses her Disguise kit to turn some people</p>
<p>Group 1 - <em>Avren</em>, <em>Viker</em>, <em>Steve</em>, and <em>Tasbros</em> leave in various disguises to infiltrate the Derro.</p>
<p>Group 2 - Meanwhile, the rest of us question guards to see if anyone can help us. The first guard we question doesn’t know anything. He tells us the East Wing is where the more wealthy are, and the West is the slum.</p>
<p>Group 1 notices everyone around is acting severely insane. The Derro look the group’s way, but don’t attack. They seem to be preoccupied. <em>Avren</em> looks for a gathering place and doesn’t find one. No one is selling anything, there is no graffiti or propaganda, like these beings are barely sentient.</p>
<p><em>Avren</em> reports back to Group 2 that she cannot find anything and we should head to the West side. We rest at the inn again and head to the West Wing.</p>
<p>After we arrive, Group 1 disguises themselves again. They head in and see a ton of people muttering like the West end, but <em>Avren</em> barely sees a tunnel that is emitting a fog from behind some scrap.</p>
<p>Group 2 questions a guard and said he doesn’t know how <em>Droki</em> gets by them. However, he said <em>Droki</em> always seems to get through on 1 shift, the 3rd shift. He said they come on duty in 8 hours.</p>
<p>Group 1 proceeds into the tunnel and sees fungi everywhere, a very high ceiling height (somewhat &lt; 60’ high), a weird magic feeling that represses magic users, and water dripping from the ceiling. They continue on and hear a voice in her mind: “Hello there, you’re not Derro. I know you’re looking for Derro and they have been corrupting my cave. Are you going to get rid of the Derro?” <em>Tasbros</em> replies “what’s it worth to you?” and he says “nothing, you have nothing I want. <em>Avren</em> said “have you heard of <em>Droki</em>?” and he says “yes, he is further in my cave. Are you going to take him out?” <em>Viker</em> responds “why can’t you get him out?” and he did not answer. <em>Viker</em> goes to grab Group 2 while Group 1 tries to track down the location of <em>Droki</em> by telepathy.</p>
<p>We discuss and can’t find a way in to help Group 1, so I hand her my manacles in case she finds <em>Droki</em>. I mention to <em>Geral</em> that we might be able to bring this information back to the chief to get an army to head in and get <em>Droki</em>.</p>
<p>We decide to cast <em>Viker</em>’s Daylight spell on her manacles and we walk very quickly through the growing crowd of Derro to the cave.</p>
<p>Group 1 hears lots of screeching and finally see <em>Viker</em> and the rest of the group follow into the cave. We join up and attempt to find <em>Droki</em>. <em>Viker</em> leaves her Daylight spell at the bottleneck of the cave, to keep the Derro out.</p>
<p>In our minds, we see a figure bent over some symbol drawn on the ground with darkness surrounding it. We understand this as the figure we need to find. We suddenly find a large red creature that I immediately recognize as a Balor demon with an ox face, horns, large wings, a huge sword, and a fire whip.</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/balor.png" alt="Balor" /></p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li>The creature Teleports near us and whips us, doing 15 HP damage. Another hit does 16 slashing and 10 lightning damage. <em>Steve</em> gets hit for 13 HP damage and pulled back with the whip.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> Shadow Steps behind <em>Droki</em> and hit him with his staff, doing 27 HP damage. And uses his stunning strike, but misses.</li>
<li>The Derro attacks <em>CoralKing</em> back and does 65 HP damage. He Teleports behind the group.</li>
<li>Everyone within 30 ft of <em>Calmul</em> gains 6 HP in health.</li>
<li>I cast Crusader’s Mantle</li>
<li><em>Avren</em> hits the Balor with her rapier and only 3 HP hits.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> uses Primal Savagery on the Balor and does 20 HP damage. She also casts her spirit totem.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> moves over to the Derro and hits hit twice, doing 21 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> moves away from the Balor, provoking an opportunity attack of 25 HP damage. He casts Hunter’s Mark and shoots a lightning arrow and a magic arrow, doing 31 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> is entangled, and attempts to break free, but fails.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> casts Haste on me.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 2</p>
<ol>
<li>The Balor whips us again and does 10 HP damage. He attacks me and does 23 slashing damage and 14 lightning. A second hit does 22 slashing, and 16 lightning damage.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> does 28 HP damage and a stunning strike misses.</li>
<li>The Derro hits <em>CoralKing</em> for 23 HP damage, Teleports next to <em>Benjamin</em> and does 24 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> gets hit but shoots and misses.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> tries to use Hold Person but fails.</li>
<li><em>Avren</em> casts Mass Heal Wounds for 23 HP.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> moves 30 feet away from the Balor, summons a giant scorpion, and uses Healing Word on me for 31 HP and 11 HP on everyone else. Her scorpion does 20 HP damage to the Derro.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> runs to the Derro and hits him with menacing strike for 13 HP.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> finds it has no weaknesses but is resistant to stuff.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> attempts to cast Confusion, but the Balor saves.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 3</p>
<ol>
<li>The Balor hits me for 19 slashing damage and 12 HP lightning damage. Also, everyone gets 7 HP fire damage.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> Shadow Steps behind the Balor and uses his Staff of Striking for 30 HP damage and uses stunning strike but misses.</li>
<li><em>Droki</em> Teleports into darkness and <em>Calmul</em> becomes blind. He gets hit for 25 HP and 33 HP total.</li>
<li>We hear a grunt from the direction of <em>Calmul</em></li>
<li>I move to the Balor, cast Blinding Smite, and hit the Balor twice, doing 103 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Avren</em> uses Mass Cure Wounds on <em>Calmul</em>, <em>CoralKing</em>, me, <em>Steve</em>, Steel Defender, and <em>Benjamin</em> for 20 HP.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> does 22 HP acid damage</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> asks me to hit the Balor for 31 HP and he hits him for 14 HP. He also does another 10 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> summons Bigby’s Hand and uses grasping hand, but instead adds chaos. We all take 2 HP necrotic damage.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> summons a Velociraptor and his attack does 10 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> approaches and uses her Mace of Disruption, doing 25 HP damage. She Fey Steps away.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 4</p>
<ol>
<li>Everyone takes 6 HP fire damage. I get hit and knocked down. <em>Viker</em> gets 21 HP of slashing damage and 10 HP lightning damage.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> moves to the Balor and uses his Flurry of Blows. He hits once for 5 HP damage.</li>
<li>The darkness disappears from our sight range and <em>Tasbros</em> gets 10 HP damage from a flying arrow, but avoids being poisoned.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> stands up and moves away from the Balor. He misses 2 shots with his musket.</li>
<li><em>Avren</em> casts Thunder Clap and moves to attempt to find <em>Droki</em>.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> does 23 HP damage with the Mace of Disruption, and the Balor explodes in death. Some of us take another 45 HP damage and some take 90 HP, including me. I start to feel the pull of the afterlife. The Steel Defender and the Velociraptor die dramatic deaths. <em>Viker</em> casts Mass Cure Wounds for 19 HP and she uses her Mace's Light Aura while moving toward the Derro.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Benjamin</em> tries to track down this <em>Droki</em>. The Darkness disappears, so he is trying to escape. <em>Viker</em> quickly tries to get Daylight back up while <em>Benjamin</em> finds a track mark. We know that the Derro has left the cave.</p>

<p>After our fight we are in the cave and the sphere of darkness continuing <em>Droki</em> has dissipated. We go back through the <strong>West Cleft District</strong> gates to <strong>Gholbrorn's Lair</strong>, the tavern under the docks. We take a long rest and <em>Geral</em> gives an inspiring speech. The innkeeper is a Duergar and speaks Common. <em>Geral</em> asks if he has any surface food such as eggs. The innkeeper chuckles and said yes, for a price. He also has bacon. <em>Geral</em> orders eggs and bacon. We eat while <em>Geral</em> asks him if he knows anything about Droki’s whereabouts. He responds just that he lives in the <strong>West Cleft District</strong>. We decide to head back to the <strong>West Cleft District</strong> and time our arrival so that the new guard shift is on.</p>
<p>We hear a mob approaching us on our path. <em>Wulrif</em> tries to Detect Thoughts. He sends his familiar 60 feet in the air to get a better view. They seem angry and insane. I cast Daylight in the center of our group. <em>Wulrif</em> fails to pick up thinking creatures not seen by us. Eventually, the mob moves around us and onward. We continue. <em>Geral</em> asks whats going on. The guard responds that they’ll be put down soon. Then we hear a slaughter. We go through the gate and <em>Calmul</em> notes Cannons on every tower that swivel in any direction.</p>
<p>As we approach the gate, <em>Geral</em> asks if they saw the Derro come by here. He said they don't let groups more than 5 through at a time. <em>Wulrif</em> asks if they saw <em>Droki</em>. He said if they had seen him, he would be arrested or dead. <em>Wulrif</em> tells the guard <em>Droki</em> is a magic user and that we are going to be operating in this region to find him. The guard understands.</p>
<ul>
<li>Group 1 - <em>CoralKing</em> and <em>Wulrif</em></li>
<li>Group 2 - Me, <em>Geral</em>, <em>Calmul</em>, <em>Wulrif</em>’s Familiar, and <em>Benjamin</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Group 2 staggers ourselves 10 ft apart inside the city gate (leading away from the gate), about 40 ft away from the gate.</p>
<p>Group 1 walks outside of the gate and we all wait. We don’t see him go by for a full cycle. We regroup back at the inn, rest, and <em>Geral</em> asks if he has seen any strange happenings at all recently. He responds yes that he kicked some people out yesterday that were saying strange things. He said he doesn’t pay much attention though.</p>
<p>We decide to go to the <strong>Overlake Hold</strong> and interrogate the prisoners. We ask to question them. We are led to them and we see some Orcs, Gnomes, and Dwarves. None of them are doing anything odd. <em>Geral</em> questions the Gnomes and asks them what happened last cycle. They said “You've heard it too?” and he replies “I’ve seen it and what it does to people.” They say &quot;Oh, you have the gift too?” and they start discussing a lady. He seems to be following the desire of a female presence. She comes in his dreams and he sees her every night since he “accepted her.” and he drones on about her for some time.</p>
<p><em>Wulrif</em> takes over and feels a presence in his mind. He feels warm, light, and wonderful. He feels like he’s about to be blessed if he accepts it. <em>Wulrif</em> rejects it and is kicked out.</p>
<p><em>CoralKing</em> takes over and questions the Gnomes. He questions them and he said they got mad. <em>Wulrif</em> checks the Dwarves and we get the same thing.</p>
<p><em>Geral</em> questions the Orcs and asks how long they have been down there. He asks if they got invitations to join a woman in some blissful…and they respond in a weird face before he finishes his sentence. They just seem to be interested in violence, in the spirit of violence. They said they don’t deserve to be down here because they killed a couple of Dwarves. They claim to have not started the fight and were defending themselves from stupidity. They seem to know about the corruption and want us to put in a good word for them to be removed from prison because they were fighting the corruption.</p>
<p>We go to the main office of the Duergar Captain and explain what happened with <em>Droki</em> and the Balor. She said it doesn’t sound like him if he is creating a dark spell. We explain about the Orcs in the prison and they offer to have <strong>The Keepers of the Flame</strong> interrogate them.</p>
<p><em>Geral</em> asks if they have anything to capture a magic user because of the magic dampening properties of the city. She suggests we consult <strong>The Keepers of the Flame</strong>, which <em>Geral</em> is hesitant to do. So, he asks if she suggests a specific contact within the Keepers. She said <em>Gartokkar</em> would probably speak with us. We ask where to find them and she said the Wyrmsmith’s Chambers.</p>
<p>We head there and look for <em>Gartokkar</em> and we hear a bizarre language none of us speak. Their minds are also closed to <em>Wulrif</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the Duergar priests lead you to a building carved from the stone just outside a huge cave entrance, the ground trembles slightly, and a thunderous voice echoes against every wall.</p>
<p>“<em>Gartokkar</em>,” the voice calls as a reptilian behemoth comes into view, it scales the color of lava, its bright yellow eyes glowing in the shadows of the cave before coming into the light. “You didn’t say I was having surfacers for dinner today.”</p>
<p>The Dragon chuckles at his own wit. His massive body gives the distinct impression that he is overweight, indicating eating habits that don’t bode well.</p>
<p>“Foreigners,” the Duergar priest says with great reverence, “meet the Father of Flame, the Everburning, and the Foundry’s Heart — <em>Themberchaud</em>, the Wyrmsmith of <strong>Gracklstugh</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="journals/images/ooa04-06.png" alt="Themberchaud" /></p>
<p>He waddles onto this massive pile of coins and we follow him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now leave us. Anyone invisible will be burned to a crisp.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Duergar priest reluctantly backs out. <em>Themberchaud</em> said he needs us to find out what issues are occurring among his staff. He said he knows of <em>Geral</em> and <strong>Phandalin</strong>. We explain how we got here and that we are just trying to get out. We explain that we are currently working on hunting down <em>Droki</em> and the spreading corruption. He asks more about the issue with <em>Droki</em>. He said he recognizes the description of the female as <em>Zuggtmoy</em>, the Queen of Fungi, and that she spreads her word via the Myconids. He tells us he has never heard of her spreading to mammals and especially Fey. He tells us to go to the Captain with his information.</p>
<p>He turns to <em>Wulrif</em> who feels an extremely strong mind connect with him to ask why we are here. <em>Wulrif</em> replies, explaining about the Koa-Toa summoning <em>Demogorgon</em>. <em>Themberchaud</em> is very interested about the Stone Giant that attacked us in the city. He telepathically enters my mind and interrogates me about what I’ve seen. I explain about the Smiling One who summoned the Purple Worm and how we ended up falling down his hole. <em>Themberchaud</em> tells me we should find the name of the Smiling One and deliver it to him as their kind have been quarreling since before Paladins existed. I then explain about the encounter with the Stone Giant and he keeps asking about his hands. I don’t remember anything particular about his hands.</p>
<p><em>Themberchaud</em> says his Keepers are hiding something from him and he wants us to figure out what it is. He says his Right Hand will give us gold badges. One of them gives me an unholy fragment of an elder god's symbol and tells me I will find it useful. They warn me I alone can neutralize it -- any others will be corrupted. They say the god was called <em>Laduguer</em> as in <strong>Laduguer’s Furrow</strong>, that splits the city in twain.</p>
<p>We told <em>Gartokkar</em> that we are searching for something they are hiding. He denies it and said he serves his master faithfully. Something seems to glow in his hands as he tells us not to cross him or his type again.</p>
<p><em>Geral</em> asks if he knows anything about the corruption going around lately. <em>Gartokkar</em> replies the Prince of Demons has been seen, the servants of <em>Zuggtmoy</em> have been more active, and she seems to have crossed the blood-brain barrier into more species. We ask about <em>Droki</em> and <em>Gartokkar</em> says he seems to be a minor spy, but a large problem for them. We mention <em>Droki</em> summoned a Balor and uses magic. He says <em>Droki</em> has taken something very valuable from <strong>The Keepers of the Flame</strong> and they are desperate to return it. He finally admits <em>Droki</em> took a Dragon’s egg. We ask if he knew that <em>Themberchaud</em> was missing an egg and he reminds us that <em>Themberchaud</em> doesn’t lay eggs. We discern that <em>Themberchaud</em> isn’t aware that his egg has gone missing. The <em>Gray Ghosts</em> are named as the culprits. They have been tracking <em>Droki</em> and we ask for any leads they have. He thinks <em>Droki</em> is a Drow. He thinks he has been using tunnels underneath the docks that are guarded by some things that are killing his scouts and infecting any others with <em>Zuggtmoy</em>’s mind spores. He says we can probably survive <strong>The Whorlstone Tunnels</strong> as we have a Paladin and a Druid.</p>
<p><em>Geral</em> explains that we will go there and attempt to retrieve the egg and ask for any map they have. <em>Gartokkar</em> said it’s controlled by the Maze Lord and they don’t have any tools for us. He mentioned about Shadowblades, the feared line of Drow House Assassins.</p>
<p>We head back to the Captain of the Stone Guard and relay what we learned. She said the <em>Zuggtmoy</em> are annoyed by light, but won’t cower away from it.</p>
<p>We agree to head to <strong>The Whorlstone Tunnels</strong>.</p>

<p>The city appears very smoky and black. Some of our group wakes up coughing and have a level of Exhaustion. Each day, we must avoid <strong>Grackle lung</strong>. I heal my team as they succumb.</p>
<p>The group heads to the armory for some armor. We stock up and head to <strong>The Whorlstone Tunnels</strong>. We have 4 visible giant-sized Stone Guard to escort us.</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/ooa04-02.png" alt="Stone Guard" /></p>
<p>We approach the tunnels and see a fissure in the granite below the docks. It’s about 5 feet wide, but very tall. We enter the tunnel and the ceiling seems to be climbing as we continue. The tunnel is very wet and dimly-lit -- it is <strong>Faerzress-Suffused</strong>, and dampens any Divination spells or Teleportation abilities as well as adds Wild Magic surges.</p>
<p>We hear chittering outside of our vision range. I see a carpet of writhing insects that are shying away from <em>Actias</em>’s Sunblade. As they move away, we see bones that are completely stripped of flesh. There is some white fur left on some bones that <em>Viker</em> recognizes as matching the hide of the satchel she just bought. One of our familiars notices a trickle of water coming down the wall. The cavern widens out and we see a ramp that continues forward and a second that leads up a level. It appears that we have entered something’s dwelling. <em>Wulrif</em> sends his familiar up to investigate with <em>Steve</em> and they see a mouth that appears in the stone wall, asking what we are doing in its owner’s workshop. <em>Steve</em> freezes in amazement that he was seen. We respond that we are looking for a Derro by the name of <em>Droki</em>. <em>Geral</em> asks who its master is. It responds that its master is busy right now.</p>
<p><em>Geral</em> walks up, takes one of his rations, and tries to feed the mouth. He is unsuccessful. Then, a giant wave-like creature appears with Plate Mail over his shoulders and a weapon in its hands. <em>Geral</em> responds that we are looking for the master. It remains stoic and blocks our way. <em>Benjamin</em> wants to use Hunter’s Sense on this thing, so he moves forward and analyzes it. <em>Wulrif</em> follows to protect him. <em>Benjamin</em> tells us that it is a Water Elemental Myrmidon, resistant to acid, piercing, slashing, immune to poison, petrification, or being knocked prone. It has no weaknesses.</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/water-elemental-myrmidon.png" alt="Water Elemental Myrmidon" /></p>
<p><em>Geral</em> notices via Blindsight that he is being surprise attacked by something invisible, but is of course, immune due to Sentinel. He alerts us. Invisible Derro appear behind <em>CoralKing</em>, <em>Wulrif</em>, and <em>Actias</em>. All of whom are surprised. <em>Wulrif</em> is attacked 3 times and takes 27 HP bludgeoning and 8 HP psychic damage (he backlashes the other 8HP of psychic damage). <em>Actias</em> takes 43 HP damage. <em>Geral</em> gets hit for 36 HP damage. He hits back three times and misses.</p>

<p>We approach the next room and feel our items lose their magic. We move slightly closer and <em>Geral</em> sees a Beholder floating about 40 feet off the ground, pinning us in the baleful glare of the central eye. We also see Constructs skittering around in the back of the room. Flesh Golems form a wall protecting the Beholder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It's a shame you broke my toys, did you bring me new ones?&quot; a Telepathic voice echoes in our heads.</p>
<p>&quot;Where is <em>Droki</em>?&quot; asks <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Scurrying down his usual rat hole to the Monolith.&quot; The huge head nods and indicates a small hole in the wall.</p>
<p>&quot;How do we get through the hole?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don't. Unless you have a shrinking potion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you have a shrinking potion?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can make one, but I'll need something for my trouble. Also, a drop of blood from each of you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your name in my Book of Shadows, if you die, I'll bring you back to life.&quot; says <em>Wulrif</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd like to see this book.&quot; says the Beholder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Wulrif</em> feels there is an extra attachment to his book. We take a short rest while the small Clockworks come by to take a drop of our blood. The Beholder busies itself in its corner, Telekinetically manipulating a cauldron and various ingredients.</p>
<p>A little while later ...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Your potions are ready. Don't get them mixed up, they are not labeled,&quot; giggles the Beholder.</p>
<p>&quot;What happens if we get them mixed up?&quot; asks <em>CoralKing</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, they're tailored to your genetics, so it might be a big problem. Or it might not be a problem. I don't know, I'm not a geneticist.&quot;</p>
<p>We carefully take our own potions to quaff.</p>
<p>&quot;One last thing, you'll need a dimensional pocket to put your extra mass in. I don't know if you have one, but you'll need one. Otherwise, you may not like what happens when you revert to your normal size.&quot;</p>
<p>A horrible chuckle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Calmul</em> eventually realizes that he has the ability to build one! He nearly disappears into a fog of animated tools and constructs, and we can see him grasping nearby objects as the object manifests. The finished product is a metal, folding contraption thing that expands and contracts in strange directions and has lots of gears on it.</p>
<p>We drink our potions and shrink, watching puddles of reddish-pinkish-brown slime drain away into <em>Calmul's</em> metal box. We are now 6&quot; high, and the air is strangely thick. <em>Benjamin</em> and <em>Wulrif</em> work together to track <em>Droki</em>, but the tunnels are long and confusing. After 8 hours of progress, <em>Benjamin</em> loses the trail and takes a guess as to which way we should travel. <em>Geral</em> gives <em>Benjamin</em> some Inspiration and he eventually recovers the track. We start to feel tingly after a long time of traveling. Then, we find ourselves in a larger area and start to see rocks orbit us. We realize that we are growing in size, and quickly get <em>Calmul</em> to open the Box of Holding so we can gain our original forms with our original mass.</p>
<p>We feel a bit out of sorts, funny tastes and twinges throughout our bodies. We are in a large cavern with a series of stepped pyramids, the Monolith on the central, highest mound. We see a bunch of Drow and Driders and, looking expectantly at us, <em>Mistress Ilvarra</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“See M’lady, here they are.” says <em>Droki</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="journals/images/Ilvarra.png" alt="Ilvarra" /></p>
<p>We are immediately faced with the blaring noise of a Shrieker, alerting every creature in this cavern of our presence.</p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> casts a spell to damage 4 Drow by 1 HP and the Shrieker, killing it. The shrieks thankfully fade.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> Teleports to the top of the highest mound and swings at the nearest Drow with his staff, doing 27 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> casts a Fireball but gets Counterspelled.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> casts Fireball at 5th level and lands 42 HP damage to the Drow, staggering them. Many are wearing burning cloaks.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> casts Firewall and does 18 HP damage on 5 Drow Elite Warriors.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> uses 2 Sorcery points and Quickens Sickening Radiance on the Drow, followed by Eldritch Blast on <em>Mistress Ilvarra</em>, which pushes her backwards 10 feet.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> shoots a Drider with his musket, because he doesn't like giant Spider-things.</li>
<li>I move forward 20 feet, cast Searing Smite, and ready my action. If I am attacked within 5 feet, I will counterattack twice with my Great Sword. A Drow Elite Warrior obliges me and I slip his strikes, countering for 31 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Droki</em> sneaks up behind <em>Wulrif</em> and backstabs him for 57 HP damage! <em>Droki</em> then disappears in a globe of Darkness. The enemies move in to surround me and <em>Benjamin</em>. They do 38 HP damage to me and a significant amount to <em>Benjamin</em>. They attack <em>Viker</em> for 20 HP damage. <em>Geral</em> is attacked and so is <em>CoralKing</em>, who gets hit for 22 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Avren</em> casts Dispel Magic and the Darkness goes away!</li>
<li>A Priestess casts Mass Cure Wounds on their forces. <em>Mistress Ilvarra</em> Dispels <em>Viker</em>’s Wall of Fire, which is burning up her warriors. I get 26 HP damage and so does <em>Tysnera</em>. Simultaneously, tentacles and noxious green fumes erupt around us, holding us in place and choking us for a ton of damage.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> nimbly skips out of the way of the Black Tentacles and Cloudkill and backstabs <em>Droki</em>, avenging <em>Wulrif</em> and doing significant damage.</li>
<li><em>Geral's</em> Shield of Alertness warded him from the spells, so he charges and provokes 3 attacks of opportunity while moving to attack <em>Droki</em> 3 times. He uses Action Surge to hit him again, doing 30 HP damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 2</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> shoots the Drider <em>Calmul</em> shot, because he also doesn't like giant Spider-things.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> Shadow Steps onto the opposite side of the Monolith and attacks one of the Drow Mages, killing him and incidentally dispelling the Cloudkill, because you can't hold a Concentration Spell when you're dead.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> tries his best, but fails to hit <em>Droki</em> back with <em>Eldritch Blast</em>.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> struggles in the Black Tentacles and casts Sunbeam using his Metamagic, damaging a line of Drow as far as the Priestesses for 32 HP damage each.</li>
<li>I turn around, declare a Vow of Enmity on the Drow Elite Warrior attacking me, and swing at him. I do 31 HP and he dies. I quickly move and attack another Drow at the edge of the tentacles, doing 19 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> casts Fireball, doing 28 HP damage to a bunch of Drow. They're definitely all burning now.</li>
<li>A Drow Elite Warrior attacks <em>CoralKing</em>, doing 31 HP damage. Some Drow Crossbowmen attack <em>CoralKing</em> and miss, but hit <em>Geral</em> for 5 HP. <em>Geral</em> Saves against the poison.</li>
<li><em>Avren</em> moves out of the Black Tentacles and casts Dispel Magic again, getting rid of them!</li>
<li><em>Mistress Ilvarra</em> casts something extremely nasty at <em>Tasbros</em>, who successfully Counterspells it!</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> attacks <em>Droki</em> and misses.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> casts Daylight, covering the entire battlefield. All the Drow and Driders immediately flinch and are Disadvantaged! She also attacks a Drider and does 9 HP damage.</li>
<li>The surviving Drow Mage casts Lightning Bolt and hits <em>Benjamin</em>, <em>Tasbros</em>, and me.</li>
<li>The Driders attack <em>Viker</em> and do serious damage.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> kills one of <em>Viker</em>'s attackers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 3</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> shoots <em>Droki</em> with his bow and does 14 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> strikes <em>Droki</em> with his staff and does 46 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> casts Fireball on <em>Droki</em> and <em>Mistress Ilvarra</em>, doing 35 HP damage. That takes <em>Droki</em> out.</li>
<li><em>Calmul</em> shoots a Drider for 7 HP.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> summons a Draconic Spirit which attacks <em>Mistress Ilvarra</em>, taking her out.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> casts a Quickened Witch Bolt on the remaining Priestess, killing her. He casts Eldritch Blast on the remaining Mage, hitting him 3 times for 40 HP. He completely flies off the mound and dies a horrific death.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> heals <em>Wulrif</em> for 70 HP, reviving him from the brink of death!</li>
<li>The 2 remaining Drow Elite Warriors touch the Monolith and disappear.</li>
<li><em>Avren</em> casts Mass Cure Wounds on us for 20 HP each.</li>
<li>I barely avoid getting hit by the Driders. <em>Tasbros</em> Dragon Spirit interposes and takes 19 HP from a Drider. I do 40 damage on a Drider.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> directs a Commander's Strike on me to hit the Drider and we kill one.</li>
<li>I finally do significant damage on another Drider.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 4</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> sprints up to where <em>Droki</em> is before a Drider can drag him away.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> Eldritch Blasts the Drider near Benjamin, knocking it back.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> uses his Dragon Spirit to attack the Drider attacking him and misses. He then uses Chromatic Orb on it, doing 15 HP damage and setting it on fire.</li>
<li><em>Steve</em> uses a Sneak Attack with his crossbow for big damage on <em>Tasbros</em> Drider.</li>
<li>I move up to <em>Droki</em>, throw my manacles to <em>CoralKing</em> and direct him to cuff our prisoner. He does so.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> Magic Missiles a Drider for guaranteed damage.</li>
<li><em>Avren</em> shoots a Drider 9 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> does Commander's Strike on <em>Wulrif</em> to Eldritch Blast a Drider. He and <em>Geral</em> do 28 HP.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 5</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> does 22 HP damage to a Drider.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> uses Ice Knife and freezes a Drider in place.</li>
<li><em>Geral</em> runs down to the Drider and does 11 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> uses Ray of Frost on another Drider.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> does 28 HP damage on the same Drider, killing it.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> turns and throws a dart at the remaining Drider for 12 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> shoot the Drider and kills it!</li>
</ol>
<p>I pull out my dark religious symbol gifted to me from the Dragon. It is strongly drawn to the Monolith, leaping out of my hand and merging with it. The Monolith heals a crack, there's a flash, and we find ourselves in a maze. A confusing blur, twisting in unknown directions, and then ...</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/death-knight.png" alt="Death Knight" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're in a giant shuddering space, filled with clanking and the smell of machinery. We see enormous industrial Smelters, and a huge armored form standing amidst a circle of a dozen slain <strong>Templar</strong>. Lines drawn in blood and ash form a summoning circle
which has a glowing black rift that <em>something</em> is coming through. The figure turns to us.</p>
<p>He's clad in blackened, tarnished Adamantium Plate draped with the smoking remnants of a <strong>Templar's</strong> White and Red tabard. Glowing red orbs contemplate us from the eye slits of his helmet. He's holding a huge sword which reeks with the stench of death.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>I SACRIFICED MY FRIENDS TO SUMMON YOU!!!</strong>&quot; screams the armored form.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>I AM <em>BAPHOMET</em>, LORD OF MAZES, AND YOU WILL ALL DIE!</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="journals/images/baphomet.png" alt="Baphomet" /></p>
<p><em>Wulrif</em> attempts Telekinesis to lift up the screaming guy, but fails. I recognize him as a Death Knight, a fallen Paladin, doomed to state the act that turned him. A terrifying 20 foot tall Fiend steps through the portal. We realize that we are somehow in <strong><a href="journals/../background/neverwinter.html">Neverwinter</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>

<p>We search the remnants and take the sword, an Unholy Avenger. A platoon of Crusaders come running swords drawn, see the mess, and do magical forensics of our battle.
They bring us, under polite guard, upstairs to the <strong>Armory</strong> of <strong><a href="journals/../background/neverwinter.html">Neverwinter</a></strong> directly to their <em>Commandant</em>.</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/the-armory.png" alt="The Armory" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;How did you come to be in my city?&quot; asks the <em>Commandant of the Crusaders</em>. A bluff, grizzled Human with a trace of grey hair in a buzz cut, wearing a full suit of well-cared for Plate. He somehow manages to sit behind a large desk with a
a large sword strapped to his back.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't rightly know, we were in a maze and then we were here.&quot; replies <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;And then we fought the <em>Lord of Mazes</em> and sent him back to the Abyss.&quot; says <em>Wulrif</em>, helpfully.</p>
<p>The <em>Commandant</em> eyes <em>Wulrif</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;You seem to have a fallen <strong><a href="journals/../game/apostolic-see.html#templar">Templar</a></strong>,&quot; I add.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, that's a matter for the ... other ... Paladins to decide. By the way, where is his sword?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have it,&quot; I reply.</p>
<p>&quot;You're going to want to take that to the <strong><a href="journals/../game/magisterium.html">Magisterium</a></strong>, and soon. I understand that Death Knights can be ... persistent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;M'lord?,&quot; asks <em>Geral</em>. &quot;You have some prior knowledge?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm no lord,&quot; replies the <em>Commandant</em>. &quot;Rising through the ranks of the <a href="journals/../background/neverwinter.html#military">Crusaders</a> is based on merit, not birth. And you seem familiar to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Major Geral Bryn</em>, retired, at your service, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, yes, I remember you now. You were the one involved in that incident with the Aboleths. I'm glad to see you're still alive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I see your Armorer is still with you. I'm glad you're alive too, <em>Sergeant Calmul</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Burn it with fire,&quot; replies <em>Calmul</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed,&quot; muses the <em>Commandant</em>, speculatively. &quot;I'm sure the <strong><a href="journals/../game/magisterium.html">Magisterium</a></strong> will be interested in your story. I'll have a squad escort you there to deal with your ... prisoner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Prisoner?&quot; asks <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; chuckles the <em>Commandant</em>. &quot;<em>Lord Varkosian</em> will certainly come out of that sword for Round Two, in about twenty hours, if I'm not mistaken.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then we'd better hurry,&quot; says <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Dismissed,&quot; says the <em>Commandant</em>, with a twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>&quot;With all due respect, sir, we're not in service anymore.&quot; says <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, the forms will be ready for your Recommissioning at your Investiture, I imagine.&quot; The Commandant stands and smiles, then executes a textbook salute. &quot;I won't hold your noble rank against you.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our escorts snap to attention when we leave the <em>Commandant's</em> office. We wind our way out of the hulking <strong>Armory</strong>, <em>Calmul</em> in some sort of reverie, analyzing the guns and machinery defending the fortress. We are escorted to an
express elevator Topside, opening into the famous <strong><a href="journals/../background/neverwinter.html#level-7">Hanging Gardens</a></strong>. <em>Benjamin</em> and <em>Viker</em> look around in delight as we come to the shining crystal towers of the <strong><a href="journals/../game/magisterium.html">Magisterium</a></strong>.</p>
<p><img src="journals/images/magisterium.png" alt="The Magisterium" /></p>
<p>The Initiates politely but firmly ask that we remain in the lobby, filled with moving paintings of donors and long-dead Chancellors. <em>Tasbros</em> and <em>Tysnera</em> are escorted into the inner sanctum, the Unholy Avenger in <em>Tysnera's</em> Bag of Holding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Enter,&quot; intones a voice formally, the room dark except for the Examiner's table and glowing crystal orb. Seven robed figures sit in a semicircle around the table, their faces hidden in shadow.</p>
<p>&quot;What are we doing here?&quot; asks <em>Tasbros</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;We have brought the Unholy Avenger,&quot; says <em>Tysnera</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;How shall we deal with this artifact?&quot; asks the voice.</p>
<p>&quot;We should destroy it,&quot; says <em>Tysnera</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Destruction of an artifact is a serious matter,&quot; says the voice. &quot;What is your reasoning?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is a weapon of evil, and it is cursed,&quot; says <em>Tysnera</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Destruction would require the fires of an Ancient Red Dragon, or access to the Deep Underdark. Do you have such access?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We should cleanse it,&quot; says <em>Tasbros</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;How would you cleanse it?&quot; asks the voice.</p>
<p>&quot;We would need to find a way to release the soul of <em>Lord Varkosian</em> from the sword,&quot; says <em>Tasbros</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;That would be a matter for the <strong><a href="journals/../game/apostolic-see.html#templar">Templar</a></strong>,&quot; says the voice. &quot;Do you have any other suggestions?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We could suppress the magic of the sword,&quot; says <em>Tysnera</em>. &quot;You have an Anti-Magic Field, don't you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We do,&quot; says the voice. &quot;But that would not be a permanent solution.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We will consult with our friends,&quot; says <em>Tysnera</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; says the voice. &quot;We will keep the sword suppressed until you return.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; says <em>Tysnera</em>. They turn to go.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait,&quot; says the voice. &quot;We have a question for you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes?&quot; asks <em>Tysnera</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;We have seen the traces of your battle with <em>Baphomet</em>. That was a skillful use of Mana.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; says <em>Tasbros</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;We would like to offer you the position of <em>Magister</em>. You would be required to teach others your techniques, of course. It comes with a stipend, and you would be granted access to the <strong>Library</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Tasbros</em> and <em>Tysnera</em> look at each other.</p>
<p>&quot;We will consider your offer,&quot; says <em>Tysnera</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Twenty-four hours later, we are in <strong>St. Paul's Cathedral</strong>, staring at the dizzying spiral that is the <strong><a href="journals/../game/peerage.html">Ledger of the Peerage</a></strong>. <em>Geral</em> is resplendent in his new uniform, and <em>Calmul</em> is wearing a new suit of Crusader Armor. <em>Tasbros</em> and <em>Tysnera</em> are in the robes of the <strong><a href="journals/../game/magisterium.html">Magisterium</a></strong>, <em>Wulrif</em> in a dark suit. <em>Avren</em> sparkles in a silken many-hued dress, humming and taking note of the spectacle for later recounting. My armor is buffed and polished.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Where are <em>Benjamin</em> and <em>Viker</em>?&quot; asks <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Fussing over a Dragon's egg,&quot; I reply.</p>
<p>&quot;CoralKing?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not his thing,&quot; I commiserate. &quot;He's off with <em>Steve</em>. They send their regards.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; says <em>Geral</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Game time,&quot; I say. &quot;You look great, by the way.&quot;</p>
<p>He nods and smiles. &quot;You too.&quot;</p>
<p>Squaring his shoulders, <em>Geral</em> and <em>Calmul</em> stride confidently to the base of the <strong><a href="journals/../game/peerage.html">Ledger of the Peerage</a></strong>.</p>
<p><em>Marchioness Lyanna Alagondar</em>, the ruling Temporal Lord of <strong><a href="journals/../background/neverwinter.html">Neverwinter</a></strong>, is standing there, flanked by the <em>Commandant of the Crusaders</em> and the <em>Legate of the Apostolic See</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Marchioness</em> acknowledges their arrival, and a golden orb floats over to <em>Geral</em>, pulsing. He nods gravely. The orb touches his finger, turning red, then soars to the top of the <strong>Ledger</strong>, which pulses golden.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Major Geral Bryn</em>, retired, is now made <em>Baron of Cragmaw</em>,&quot; intones <em>Marchioness Alagondar</em>. &quot;All privileges and responsibilities are granted to him and his legal heirs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Major Geral Bryn</em>, retired, I formally reactivate you to the rank of <em>Colonel of the Crusaders</em>,&quot; says the <em>Commandant</em>. &quot;You are to assume command of the 349th Guards Regiment and proceed forthwith to Cragmaw in performance of your duties.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Geral</em> briskly salutes the <em>Commandant</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Sergeant Calmul Rhoqiroth</em>, you are mustered to the 349th Guards Regiment with the rank of <em>Master Gunnery Sergeant of the Crusaders</em>. You are to assume responsibility for the armaments and defenses of <strong>Cragmaw Castle</strong> and environs.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Calmul</em> swishes his tail and puffs his crest. The <em>Commandant</em> salutes him.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Lord Colonel Geral Bryn</em>, <em>Baron of Cragmaw</em>, I request and require your service to defend the peoples of the March,&quot; intones <em>Marchioness Alagondar</em>.</p>
<p><em>Geral</em> kneels and swears his oath. The <em>Legate</em> taps him on each shoulder with the <strong>Holy Sceptre</strong>, and he rises.</p>
<p>He turns and nods to us, smiling wistfully. Then he and <em>Calmul</em> march out of <strong>St. Paul's</strong>, flanked by the Honor Guard of the 349th.</p>

<p>We are in <strong><a href="journals/../background/neverwinter.m">Neverwinter</a></strong> and decide we are going on a quest to repair my Unholy Avenger. We try to find out how to repair the weapon. We find out that the sword must not be a focus for the Death Knight to disconnect from it. The weapon has aftermarket magic runes on it that seem to be corrupting the weapon. We decide to go to the magic store of <strong><a href="journals/../background/neverwinter.m">Neverwinter</a></strong>. <em>Actias</em> asks around for a Feather Fall token. We buy various magic items. Then, I ask the shopkeeper if he knows of anything we can use to rid evil from my weapon. He responds that he isn’t the <strong>Templar</strong>. So, we get directions to the <strong>Magisterium</strong> to find the <strong>Templar</strong>.</p>
<p>He responds that he knows of us. We killed <em>Lord Varkosian</em>, the Paladin-turned-Death Knight. We ask why he did what he did to become a Death Knight. He said he saw him in the chapel atoning several times a week. <em>Actias</em> asks if he knows of anything he can do to atone for his sins. He says he doesn’t know but we could talk to his wife. We ask where to find her, he asks a sergeant to lead us to his quarters. We arrive to find it empty, but looks like 1 person has been living there for several months. The second person seemed to have packed up and left. <em>Actias</em> finds a crystal cube with an impression of a woman’s face in it. I put it in my Bag of Holding. We don’t find any other clues in the place. We ask the sergeant if he had seen her lately and he said the last time he saw her, she was in an airship. He directed us to the Air Masters. We head there to ask. We see an orb and ask about the Air Master. It responds that she is busy. We ask about the lady Varkosian and he said “on whose authority can I release these records?”</p>
<p>We go back to the Artificer to ask if he knows how to purge the curse on the weapon. He said we need to release <em>Lord Varkosian</em>'s soul from the sword to cleanse it. He said it’s possible to enter the sword but we would have to enter the shadowfell. So, we head back to the <strong>Templar</strong> to ask him how to release the Death Knight’s soul. He tells us only a <strong>Templar</strong> could investigate something like that. He asks if I would like to become a <strong>Templar</strong>. The only downside is that I would have to take a vow of poverty, I can requisition supplies whenever needed.</p>
<p>I begin the quest of the <strong>Templar</strong>…</p>
<p>The first task is the purification ritual. I must fast for a cycle and sit in prayer. Then, I must sit in front of a panel who judge my trial by combat as complete as I slayed the Death Knight. Provisionally, I am now a <strong>Templar</strong>. I will complete my quest to become a full-fledged <strong>Templar</strong> if I purge <em>Lord Varkosian</em>’s soul from the Unholy Avenger. I am assigned Brother <em>Harrod</em>, a Dwarf with a shaved top, to monitor me. He seems like a jolly lad. We all pray before setting off on this quest. I was granted a +2 Cloak of Protection.</p>
<p>We go back to the air hanger and ask about <em>Lady Varkosian</em>’s. The orb tells us that 3 months ago she went to <strong>Savra's Cathedral</strong>. They tell us in the magical travel area, there is a Teleportation Circle to the Cathedral. We ask about a wizard and he tells us the other end seems to be closed off. That’s when I remember we’ve been to this cathedral. That’s where we found the cursed ward stone. We go back to the orb and ask if we can requisition an airship to travel to the Cathedral. He allows it and we fly above the clouds, unable to see the sun.</p>
<p>We arrive at the Cathedral to chase down <em>Lady Varkosian</em>. <em>Actias</em> sees one of the coffins with a stake through a body that has features similar to the lady on the crystal cube. We discuss how to talk to her without freeing her or putting ourselves in danger. <em>Actias</em> decides to cast Magic Circle and <em>Wulrif</em> uses mage hand to remove the stake. She FREAKS OUT and tries to escape by hundreds of methods. She turns into a fairly attractive woman, sits down, and smiles at us asking what we need. She said she hasn’t been around the Lord until the Springrise and didn’t know he became a Death Knight. She became bored with him since he was concerned about climbing the ladder of the **<strong>Templar</strong> and she wanted a family. She decided to pray about it. The Vampire Lord came to her and converted her to a Vampire. Then, she left.</p>
<p>She thinks she has something to do with her husband being converted. She thinks <em>Lord Varkosian</em> was trying to reconnect with her by doing that. Then, she spends quite some time trying to seduce <em>Actias</em>. We decide to stake her again and put her in <em>Wulrif</em>’s Bag of Holding. Then, we seek out the Vampire Lord. <em>Actias</em> attempted to swallow the Bag of Holding. He expresses to all of us how desperately he wants to become a Dhampir.</p>
<p>We head back to <strong>Phandalin</strong> via an airship because we know <em>Sister Garaele</em> can cast divination spells. She said she has a good idea of where this Vampire Lord is. She knows of a town that fell, called <strong>Axeholm</strong>, and there are a ton of Undead there. Since our party is pretty thin, we decide to stay in <strong>Phandalin</strong> and pursue this quest for <em>Actias</em>.</p>
<p>He needs to find a way to Shadowfell. She said deep in the woods there is a type of tree with a black brook underneath, and a cave that can lead to Shadowfell as long as we do the correct ritual. She instructs <em>Actias</em> how to perform the ritual. We wait for the correct opportunity and the ritual seems to be working. We all venture into the cave.</p>
<p>We see this strange forest with open sky and a castle off in the distance. <em>Actias</em> and I both cast Magic Circle and he releases <em>Alyssa</em>. He asks her how to become a Dhampir. She tells him he has to kill lesser Vampires. We tell her about the purpose I need for her to complete my quest. She consents to become a Dhampir to help both <em>Actias</em> and myself. We cast a geas onto <em>Actias</em> and <em>Alyssa</em> to protect us from their bloodlust while they complete their quest.</p>
<p>Quickly they encounter a Vampire to battle and I cast Haste onto <em>Actias</em>.</p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Actias</em> casts Hellish Rebuke and does 5 HP damage. He wields his Sunblade and casts Hexblade’s curse. He attacks with his dancing blade and his shortsword, doing 72 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> runs up and tries to grapple the Vampire to give <em>Actias</em> advantage. He fails but Shadow Steps to the back of the Vampire to succeed in giving <em>Actias</em> advantage.</li>
<li>I harm the Vampire by 7 HP.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 2</p>
<ol>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> hits the Vampire with one unarmed strike and uses a ki point to make it a stunning strike. He does 8 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> strikes twice and does 54 HP damage with the Sunblade. That kills the Vampire. He lets out a scream as he is dissipated forever.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Alyssa</em> emerges from the distance licking blood off of her arm and is impressed by <em>Actias</em>’ kill. They proceed to the nearest river, lie under the water as they die, and I pull them from the water at the last moment. They are now both Dhampir. We realize the importance of leaving the area before we take a long rest. We quickly head back to <strong>Phandalin</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Alyssa</em> asks what happened to her husband. I explain in a persuasive way that he killed his friends to reunite with her, summoning a demon and became a Death Knight.</p>
<p>He had friends in the order who were very secretive and seemed more sketchy than the rest of the **<strong>Templar</strong>. I recall that the <strong>Templar</strong> are the people in the church who fight the occult. A branch of them worship <em>Baphomet</em> for unknown reasons. I ask <em>Harrod</em> about the <strong>Illuminati</strong>. He is alarmed that they got to <em>Lord Varkosian</em> and is confused about how to summon <em>Baphomet</em> without their involvement. With the Arclight, there are no Shapeshifters or Undead. They guard the Teleportation Circles. He thinks there has to be a Teleportation portal that is compromised in order to get the <strong>Illuminati</strong> in, as they are usually Shapeshifters.</p>
<p>He asks <em>Alyssa</em> if there is anything that caused her and the lord to have marital problems. She said he started associating closer with the group, but she doesn’t think he took potions or anything. She said to sacrifice 12 members of his order would have been very difficult. He must have poisoned them or put a spell on them or something since they had no obvious wounds. We decide to head back to <strong><a href="journals/../background/neverwinter.m">Neverwinter</a></strong> with <em>Alyssa</em>.</p>

<p><em>CoralKing</em> decides he wants to go on his journey to <strong>Phandalin</strong> and talk to <em>Chiyo</em> about his BLOOD FURY tattoo. <em>Viker</em> transforms into a horse to carry <em>CoralKing</em> and I summon a steed so we get there faster. We ride by a herd of elephants and wave to them. They wave their trunks back at us.</p>
<p>We arrive in <strong>Phandalin</strong> and head to Tresendar Manor, where the Orcs are. They recognize us and <em>Viker</em> says “boo.” <em>CoralKing</em> said “greetings best friends.” They respond to “oh, the Gnome talks. What can we do for you lady Orky?” <em>CoralKing</em> said we are looking for “<em>Chiyo</em>” and they barely subside their fury. They said she is busy, but they would let her know we are looking for her. I tell them it’s a matter of great importance and smile. They cheerfully agree, ask us to wait in their foyer, and hastily run off. <em>Chiyo</em> appears and asks what we need. I explain that <em>CoralKing</em> is in need of a Blood Fury tattoo. She says “in need of?” and chuckles. I ask what we would need to fulfill that quest.</p>
<p>She says we would need to find someone with the skill to hold that pattern. <em>CoralKing</em> asks who could? She responds that she could, but she needs some things. We need to slay Icewing, who was the Dragon who exiled the Orcs. We could slay a black Dragon in Dead Man’s Marsh instead. She needs white Dragon and black Dragon blood to make the ink. She said we need access to her workshop for the tattoo, so we need to deal with Icewing for access since it’s lair is in her workshop. She said the tattoo would take 7 cycles and it needs to be done on Autumnset, when the shadowfell is open, which is in 200 hours.</p>
<p>We ask <em>Chiyo</em> how we can possibly beat these Dragons. She responds that her whole tribe couldn’t beat Icewing, so they don’t know. She cannot spare the troops and cannot recommend mercenaries. Benjamin tells us Icewing is slightly weaker than the black Dragon.</p>
<p>We decide there’s no way to take down any of the Dragons and decide to try and follow <em>Viker</em>’s quest instead. So, we head to <strong>[Neverwinter]</strong> to get more information. I petition as a <strong>Templar</strong> to stand before the inquisition. They agree to hear me. They offer me condolences. I ask why and they told me my father died. I have 3 cycles to present myself to the <strong>Ledger</strong> in <strong>St. George’s Cathedral</strong> to undergo a genetic scan. Then, they will analyze that my genetic pattern matches his and I will inherit his lands and titles to me, since my half brothers’ fell as well. This is about a 4 hour ceremony. I find out my father fell in <strong>Icewind Dale</strong> in battle against Frost Giants.</p>
<p>I present myself and meanwhile, <em>Viker</em> presents to the Inquisition. <em>Viker</em> notices the human woman is wearing a cloak covered in eyeballs. She tells her she has to root out some evil and prove herself to enter into the society. She asks how and the human tells her to find the <strong>Illuminati</strong> and the unguarded Teleportation Circles. <em>Viker</em> asks what they are like, she is told they are Shapeshifters by race. The human wants to know how they got here.</p>
<p><em>CoralKing</em> figures out that magic items can be traced by their makers. <em>Viker</em> goes to the Cathedral with the **<strong>Templar</strong>. I join the group while <em>Viker</em> is trying to track down the <strong>Illuminati</strong>. I find <em>Harrod</em> and he congratulates me on my ascension with his condolences. I ask him if he knows of anything about the <strong>Illuminati</strong>. He tells me it has led some Templars astray and <em>CoralKing</em> can tell he is telling the truth. I ask if he will help us take down the <strong>Illuminati</strong> because I don’t have anyone else I can trust. He says <em>Lord Varkosian</em> had a lot of influence, but he trusts the head of our order. The head’s name is <em>Lord Sozenskaat</em>. I ask <em>Harrod</em> for an audience with the Lord. A cycle passes and we are ushered into his office. A light is in his room and it shines on the entire room. There are 2 suits of armor sitting nearby with slight clanking sounds and roaming muskets. I ask what he knows about the <strong>Illuminati</strong> and he tells me that he thinks they might be changelings, which are a constructed race with the innate ability to modify their bodies. Shapeshifters magic would be canceled by the Arclight. It’s not magic, but they were magically constructed to have that ability. He thinks changelings are doing this by taking 1 form and not changing that form while under the Arclight.</p>
<p>Changelings are fey or infernal. <em>Lord Varkosian</em> has proved that changelings are somewhere in the city. They don’t have families, but are identical in a given group. We call them clones or clades. He thinks we have a clade of infernal changelings. He doesn’t know how they got here but this is the time that <strong>[Neverwinter]</strong> is stationary and they would have had to make it past the Crusaders. He knows of the unguarded Teleportation Circles and the unguarded gateway summoned by <em>Lord Varkosian</em>. I ask if we should go after the unguarded circles. The other approach would be finding pulses of demonic activity in areas where the Arclight doesn’t shine in the lower levels. In addition, barriers are present. <em>Lord Varkosian</em> would have had to take them down. So, maybe see how that happened. We can talk to the Artificers guild, many of these areas are guarded by the constructs, where no living things go. The Artificers create the constructs.</p>
<p>I tell an Artificer that I am investigating weak spots in the defenses of <strong>[Neverwinter]</strong>. He seems flustered and speaks into a bunch of copper tubes. Then, suddenly a light appears in the distance. It becomes obvious I am supposed to follow it. We all follow and we see a military-themed office. We see a Gnome and he seems suspicious of <em>CoralKing</em>. I tell him that we have evidence of the defenses of <strong>[Neverwinter]</strong> being breached. He asks where we were when <em>Baphomet</em> was summoned. I can’t remember and neither can anyone else. He thinks it may have been an input grate with a filter, where they take things in from the outside. He asks if we were fighting on a conveyer belt and I say no. He said that narrows it down. I ask if he knows anywhere else to go or anyone else to talk to. He gives us 2 constructs to follow us. One moves very quickly and we follow it. <em>Viker</em> transforms into a horse fly and chases after it. She barely keeps up with it. We weave through the passageways and we are led to a conveyer belt with rocks and we see the Arclight reflected onto each belt. Except we see two light sources with a missing lenses. The constructs are confused. The conveyer belt that is unilluminated is bringing up debris, but we also notice something moving on it. We see 4 earth monsters and a coffin opening up with a blood-thirsty creature approaching. I know Vampires can’t go to any place that they are not invited, but they can enter locations where no one lives…</p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> hits one of the earth creatures for 26 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> casts sunbeam on the 4 creatures and the Vampire. She does 21 HP damage on the earth monsters and 30 HP on the Vampire.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> is attacked twice, taking 71 HP damage. I get hit once for 34 HP.</li>
<li>I move toward the first earth creature, cast blinding smite, and hit the creature twice with my great sword, doing 63 HP damage.</li>
<li>The Vampire hits <em>Viker</em> for 21 HP damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 2</p>
<ol>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> hits the same creature he hit and kills it. He hits the one next to him and does 20 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> moves to redirect her sunbeam and hits 2 of the other earth creatures for 18 HP damage each and 29 HP damage to the Vampire. She also casts the bear spirit.</li>
<li>The earth creatures hit <em>CoralKing</em> and do 33 HP damage.</li>
<li>I Channel Divinity: Abjure Enemy and Vow of Enmity, which frightens the Vampire for 1 minute</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 3</p>
<ol>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> hits the earth creature with his Staff of Striking and does 7 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> redirects her sunbeam to hit all 3 earth creatures and avoid doing damage to the Vampire while it’s frightened. She does 30 HP damage to each of them.</li>
<li>I cast blinding smite and hit the closest earth creature twice, doing 50 HP damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 4</p>
<ol>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> uses Shadow Step to get advantage on hitting an earth creature. He does 36 HP damage, killing it.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> does 28 HP damage on a creature, killing it.</li>
<li>I hit the remaining creature and do 44 HP, killing it. All that remains is the Vampire.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 5</p>
<ol>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> Shadow Steps behind the Vampire and hits it twice with his Staff of Striking for 39 HP damage. He is angry now and hisses at <em>CoralKing</em>.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> hits the Vampire for 30 HP damage.</li>
<li>I miss both of my hits.</li>
<li>The Vampire moves out of the sunlight and turns into mist. We can still see the mist.</li>

<ol>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> holds his action until the sunbeam comes back.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> does 58 HP damage, burning it completely.</li>
</ol>
<p>We turn around and see many more coffins begin to open.</p>

<p><em>Tysnera</em> and <em>Tasbros</em> were at the <strong>Magisterium</strong> and they rejoined the group. As we see dozens of Vampires begin to rise from their coffins. We decide to exit the city via the ramps. We see a group of humanoids in the distance. They are dropping off coffins in front of where we are. We have clearly found the supply chain of the Vampires. We wait for the city to pass and we run around to the side gate. We make our way to <em>Lord Commander Sozenskaat</em>. I relay to him what we learned. He will talk to the Artificers. He asks me to find out who is behind this operation and mentions requisitioning an airship. He tells us where to find <em>Tasbros</em> and <em>Tysnera</em>.</p>
<p>We decide to report back to <em>Viker</em>’s Inquisitor to hopefully complete her quest. <em>Viker</em> enters the ceremony while the rest of us take a long rest. Meanwhile, I was asked to oversee a raid that was conducted where we found the Vampires. 50+ coffins and Earth Elementals were found. The Earth Elementals were converted to work in the mines. I was specifically asked to see if the Vampire-import operation was moved and re-established. I report back that I didn’t see anything suspicious, but there were a couple of people I wasn’t able to monitor completely.</p>
<p>I meet <em>Viker</em> outside of her ceremony to congratulate her. She looks so spooky and regal in her new robe. **<strong>Templar</strong> run in groups of 13, <em>Lord Varkosian</em> was the lead of his cohort and he murdered the contents of his cohort. There must have been some way for him to do this easily, since he cared deeply for them. I ask Lord Commander his opinion on this situation. He said to talk to the Crusaders since they cleaned up the scene. I approach the Crusaders and ask them what they know about how they died. They showed me a photo in a crystal cube. I see a hexagram and bodies lying around in a circle. Their throats are cut. They must have been suppressed in some way to lie still while he cut their throats. He said magicians can pick up traces of spells, if that’s how he did it. <em>Tysnera</em> casts Detect Magic as a ritual to pick up on traces of magic. She picked up that there was a Sleep spell cast. However, that doesn’t make sense because the victims were far too sedated for that. We think they may have been poisoned since that’s the only non-magic way of wounding someone. We seek out the Artificer-Alchemist to ask about that. <em>Wulrif</em>’s companion seems to attract an Alchemist and this person does forensics on poisons for the Crusaders. He said they were full of Drow poison at the time of their death.</p>
<p>Now we need to summon the spirits of these people to convince them to forgive <em>Lord Varkosian</em>. We could seek out the help of a cleric and/or find out more information about Death Knights. We seek out the nearest bard and ask about how to subdue a Death Knight. He gives us a song about the legend of Death Knights.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In crypts below where shadows lie,<br />
A death knight dwells, his sword held high.<br />
No longer bound by mortal coil,<br />
He guards his realm, unyielding soil.</p>
<p>Once noble knight, a champion true,<br />
In armor bright, his banner flew.<br />
But darkened paths his steps did find,<br />
Till twisted was his noble mind.</p>
<p>No longer pledge to lord or land,<br />
He sought instead dark power's hand.<br />
Bound by oath to blackest creed,<br />
He spilled the blood of kin, in deed.</p>
<p>His soul in chains, a fiery toll,<br />
Locked away, bereft and foul.<br />
Yet still he fights, his armor worn,<br />
A living curse, forever sworn.</p>
<p>His sword ablaze with eldritch fire,<br />
A weapon fed on dark desire.<br />
His eyes alight, two orbs of coal,<br />
Windows to a shattered soul.</p>
<p>A haunting dirge his voice intones,<br />
Chilling flesh and cracking bones.<br />
A herald to his dark crusade,<br />
A promise of eternal shade.</p>
<p>Yet still within, a flicker stays,<br />
A dying light, a whispered phrase.<br />
Remnants of the knight he'd been,<br />
Before consumed by dreadful sin.</p>
<p>To vanquish him, a daunting quest,<br />
For only then may he find rest.<br />
But mark these words and heed them well,<br />
To free a soul from self-made hell.</p>
<p>For death knights are not born, but made,<br />
In choices poor and vows betrayed.<br />
And in their tale a lesson find,<br />
Of power's cost, and ties that bind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I roll my eyes while my group convinces me that it was helpful. We decide to begin this journey and try to free the Death Knight.</p>
<p>I first seek out <em>Lady Varkosian</em>. I remember that she is in <strong>Phandalin</strong>. We travel with <em>Tasbros</em> to <strong>Phandalin</strong> via Teleportation Circle. I find <em>Actias</em> in a nearby tree and speak to <em>Lady Varkosian</em>. She is confused about how we will get her into the city considering the Arclight. I decide that we will get her into the city via the coffin way we found earlier since it’s void of Arclight. We decide to guide her to the city by foot since we see no better way there.</p>
<p>Along the way, we encounter a group of Rangers sitting around a campfire discussing how they just killed a Witch, but she had sisters they can’t find. We enter the city via the coffin route and I use my Charisma to endear my fellow **<strong>Templar</strong> to my quest. They gracefully empathize and allow me to continue my intentions.</p>

<p>We decide to speak to the Crusaders on <a href="journals/../background/neverwinter.html#level-5">Level 5</a> to find out where the bodies of the slain **<strong>Templar</strong> are. <em>CoralKing</em>, <em>Actias</em>, and <em>Lady Varkosian</em> are going to the market. <em>Wulrif</em> is heading to the nearest inn on <a href="journals/../background/neverwinter.html#level-3">Level 3</a>. The Crusaders have no information, they said the <strong>Templar</strong> took the bodies and handled the investigation. So, we head to the <strong>Templar</strong> on <a href="journals/../background/neverwinter.html#level-6">Level 6</a> and speak to them. I find <em>Lord Commander Sozenskaat</em> and ask him. <em>Lady Stokes</em> was the Watch Commander at the time and he doesn’t think she has been corrupted. I invite her to have a meal at the inn that <em>Wulrif</em> is in and use him to figure out if she is being truthful.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <em>Lady Varkosian</em> remembers that she can inherit <em>Lord Varkosian’s</em> Barony due to his death. So, she and <em>Actias</em> travel up to the <strong>Ledger of the Peerage</strong> on <a href="journals/../background/neverwinter.html#level-1">Level 1</a> to begin the proceedings.
Interestingly, although Lord and Lady Varkosian have no heirs, an illegitimate child has also filed a claim and is supposedly in <strong>Conyberry</strong>, but that makes no sense because it’s been wasted by Barbarians.</p>
<p>We all congregate at the inn to question <em>Lady Stokes</em>. <em>Wulrif</em> immediately notices that he cannot read her. She explains to me that she appointed <em>Sergeant Carruthers</em> to take care of the investigation. She questioned him and he doesn’t know either. He questioned his team members and they don’t know either. She mentioned <em>Brother Basil</em>, a cleric, who would have handled the bodies after arrival at the cathedral. I decide to arrange to meet the Sergeant at the inn. He tells me that he and his men brought the bodies to Sepulchre and passed them off to <em>Brother Basil</em>. <em>Wulrif</em> notes that the Sergeant, and someone <em>Wulrif</em> cannot see, is suspicious of <em>Brother Basil</em> when he mentions him. <em>Viker</em> puts her Inquisitor's Robes on and notices a spider in the corner of the room that scuttles away immediately. <em>Wulrif</em> senses the second mind has left.</p>
<p>We make our way to <strong>St. Paul's Cathedral</strong> to question <em>Brother Basil</em>. Apparently he has gone missing before meeting <em>Father Saphil</em> to discuss a sermon. So, I seek out <em>Father Saphil</em> and he informs me that he hasn't seen him in 3 cycles. I ask if he knows anything about his disappearance and he said he has always been a strong member of my order. He also performed his original <em>Rites of Passage</em>. He mentions <em>Brother Basil's</em> mother is a miner on the <a href="journals/../background/neverwinter.html#level-0">Level 0</a> and he came from poverty. He is also young, which is why he is getting the grunt work of the mortuary.</p>
<p>We decide to take a rest cycle and have <em>Tysnera</em> tailor a spell list for investigation before heading to <em>Brother Basil</em>’s living quarters. He shares with 8 other brothers with chests at the ends of their beds. I decide to physically look around while <em>Tysnera</em> tries to open the chest. She opens it with a Knock spell and we immediately feel malaise. We see the inside of the chest is lined with lead, and inside is a strange book that is radiating extraplanar magic. <em>Tysnera</em> sees letters in a spidery script between him and his mother, in which she recognizes is Drow. <em>Tysnera</em> concludes that this is a Warlock’s Book of Shadows to <em>Llolth</em> with a 6th level spell in there. This is a tome that is gifted to the Warlock by his patron.</p>
<p>When we bring the book into the cathedral, the writing disappears. We bring it outside the cathedral and the writing reappears. I decide to rent quarters in the Noble's District on <a href="journals/../background/neverwinter.html#level-5">Level 5</a> with <a href="https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/ua/bastions-cantrips/BRF3GSu0nTfNu8p4/UA2023-BastionsCantrips.pdf">appropriate space</a>. In my new ballroom, I cast Magic Circle, as does <em>Actias</em>, and <em>Tysnera</em>. I retrieve my Bag of Holding (thanks <em>Calmul</em>!), remove the book, and open it. Some kind of spell goes off, and a Gate opens. Immediately, 4 Yochlols and a Marilith step through.</p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> casts Darkness and Shadow Steps behind the Marilith.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> casts Scatter, which teleports 5 people away from the circle.</li>
<li>The Marilith leaves the Magic Circles, attacks <em>Tasbros</em>, and does 33 HP damage, who is restrained in her coils. He is hit 3 more times, leaving him with 6 HP remaining. <em>Wulrif</em> is hit, doing 48 HP damage. 2 more Yochlols appear next to the Marilith.</li>
<li>2 of the Yochlols attack <em>CoralKing</em> twice and do 16 HP damage. <em>Actias</em> uses his reaction to attack with his Sunblade. He does 24 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> summons her Unicorn Spirit and then casts Mass Cure Wounds, healing the party for 35 HP each.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> Scatters <em>Tasbros</em> out of the grapple, and moves everyone into a strategic position where the spellcasters are against the wall and <em>Actias</em>, <em>CoralKing</em>, and me are in the front. He hits one of the Yochlols for 11 HP damage.</li>
<li>I step forward, cast Searing Smite, and attack the nearest Yochlol twice for 52 HP damage. Then, I step back into formation.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> casts Fireball and does 14 damage to the Marilith and 28 damage to the Yochlols.</li>

<li>The Yochlols attack <em>CoralKing</em> and do 12 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> uses her Mace of Disruption on the Marilith for 13 HP damage and Fey Steps away.</li>

<li><em>Tasbros</em> casts Confusion on 2 Yochlols.</li>
<li>The non-Confused Yochlol does 66 HP damage to <em>Viker</em>. I use my Chromatic Dragon Wings to protect her from further damage. <em>Actias</em> is attacked for 50 HP, initially knocking him prone. However, <em>Wulrif</em> protects him and brings him back to 1 HP.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> does 21 HP damage to a Yochlol, killing it!</li>

<p>Scimitars and the book are left behind and taken by us. Suddenly, the Crusaders appear at my <a href="https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/ua/bastions-cantrips/BRF3GSu0nTfNu8p4/UA2023-BastionsCantrips.pdf">Manor</a>. They tell us they heard screams and ask why a <strong>Templar</strong> is here. We are healed 25 HP each. They leave 20 Crusaders around the neighborhood to make everyone feel safe.</p>
<p><em>Actias</em> goes to the market to get medium armor. We restart our quest to find Brother Basil. <em>Benjamin</em> attempts to find his trail, but lost him around <a href="journals/../background/neverwinter.html#level-3">Level 3</a>. I learn about the Franciscans who help the poor, and I approach them to help me find Brother Basil’s mother. They don’t know him. <em>Actias</em> decides he wants to Scry him. So, we head back to his quarters and he tries to find some DNA. <em>Actias</em> hears mechanical machinery in the background of this image, Brother Basil is scared and trying to hide. There are 12 shrouded figures around him and he is scribing some kind of circles. It’s either in <a href="journals/../background/neverwinter.html#level-0">Level 0</a> or <a href="journals/../background/neverwinter.html#level-1">Level 1</a>, where he is located. We figure out he is on <a href="journals/../background/neverwinter.html#level-0">Level 0</a>.</p>
<p>I decide to go ask an Artificer if they can help. He said he is too busy. I ask the **<strong>Templar</strong> to seal off level 0 from all travel. <em>Benjamin</em> attempts to track Brother Basil and he picks up the trail! He leads us and we follow him to a very large room with the underside of the moving treads with a crank shaft in it. <em>Actias</em> Scries again and sees the Brother Basil is suspicious, but in the same room as before. Now he seems to be speaking to someone, but <em>Actias</em> cannot see who he is talking to. He sees a door that says “Danger, Stay Out!” and a second door with the same side. Now, <em>Actias</em> can’t see who he is speaking to, but can see a sort of shimmering portal. <em>Wulrif</em> attempts to rips the door open with telekinesis. <em>Wulrif</em> opens the door and <em>Actias</em> can see a door opening through Brother Basil’s eyes.</p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li>I cast Hold Person and succeed!</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> casts Dispel Magic and closes the portal! I think “man, we are on a roll”.</li>

<p>We bind and gag Brother Basil. I put my manacles on him. We see the 12 shrouded bodies around him. <em>Wulrif</em> looks for magic residue other than the portal. He finds the portal holds an aberration. Nothing that would help the Brother. He found some saliva from the aberration on the bodies. <em>Actias</em> casts Speak with Dead and he asks what was <em>Lord Varkosian’s</em> motivation? They remember having a supper with him but nothing else, they don’t realize they are dead. They said they were working with Lord to find a cell of the <strong>Illuminati</strong>. They thought they found a cell working with the Artificer’s Guild, and before they were to raid the cell, they had a ritual and last supper before they died. However, they don’t seem to understand that they are dead. We ask who prepared the supper and they said Lord did.</p>

<p>So, we need to get the bodies to the site of the murder. Luckily, this is on the same level. So, we can drag them. Then, we can have <em>Tasbros</em> transport me and the Unholy Avenger back and forth to the site. So, we begin by each grabbing a body.</p>
<p><em>Wulrif</em> touches <em>Brother Basil</em> and tries to Thrall him, but is pyschically bounced by some sort of powerful an entity that seems to be cohabitating. We try to find a way to make use of <em>Brother Basil</em> the best way possible. So, we ask <em>Tasbros</em> to ask someone from the <strong>Magisterium</strong> if they will pick him up and bring him back to the <strong>Magisterium</strong> to hold him in the Anti-Magic field. A specialist wizard agrees. He will come with <em>Tasbros</em> to pick him up and <em>Tasbros</em> can take the Unholy Avenger too. The wizard seems interested in coming to see what we are up to. We tell him he can return, but he needs to secure <em>Brother Basil</em> first.</p>
<p><em>Viker</em> casts Stunning Symbol in the center of the circle of bodies. The trigger is when <em>Lord Varkosian</em> steps foot on the glyph. <em>Tasbros</em> arrives…</p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> readies his action for when <em>Lord Varkosian</em> arrives.</li>
<li>The wizard puts the magic manacles on <em>Brother Basil</em>, and Teleports away.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> readies his action.</li>
<li><em>Lord Varkosian</em> arrives and Wraiths rise from all 12 of bodies. As he lands on the Symbol, a bright sphere appears. <em>Tasbros</em> is affected by the Stunning Symbol and everyone else was spared. He managed to squeak out a save and ended up fine.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> attacks <em>Lord Varkosian</em> twice with his Staff of Striking and a Flurry of Blows and does 49 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> shot at the Death Knight and did 22 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> casts Sunbeam on the Death Knight and a Wraith, doing 32 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Lord Varkosian</em> casts Hellfire Orb and hits <em>CoralKing</em>, <em>Tasbros</em>, and me for 33 HP damage. However, <em>CoralKing</em> was able to dodge it!</li>
<li>The Wraiths begin to attack all of us. <em>Tasbros</em> gets 28 HP damage. <em>CoralKing</em> is hit for 18 HP damage. <em>Benjamin</em> is hit for 14 HP damage. <em>Viker</em> takes 18 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> uses Misty Step to attack the Death Knight with Sunbeam, doing 25 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> casts Witch Bolt on the Wraiths in front of him, doing 57 HP damage.</li>
<li>I cast Spirit Shroud and hit him twice for 41 HP damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 2</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> uses Hunter's Sense on the Wraiths and learns they are resistant to Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Thunder; Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing from non-magical Attacks that aren't Silvered. They are immune to necrotic damage and poison.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> attacks the Death Knight with his Staff of Striking and does a Flurry of Blows. He deals 44 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Lord Varkosian</em> attacks me three times, for 110 HP damage.</li>
<li>The Wraiths attack <em>Tasbros</em> for 44 HP damage. <em>CoralKing</em> is attacked, uses his Protective Wings, and gets 20 HP damage. <em>Benjamin</em> is getting hit for 26 HP damage, also reducing his max HP.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> casts Mass Cure Wounds for 41 HP on the party and uses her Unicorn Spirit on <em>Benjamin</em> for 15 HP.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> casts Scatter on the party and pulls us out of the action.</li>
<li>I cast Spirit Shroud and hit <em>Lord Varkosian</em> twice for 53 HP damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 3</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> heals himself.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> speaks to the Wraiths nearest him and they don’t respond positively.</li>
<li><em>Lord Varkosian</em> is still down.</li>
<li>The Wraiths swarm the group and attack. Lady Varkosian screams “STOP! Don’t you recognize me?!?” and they stop to look at her. “You, <em>Gareth</em>, we had you over for dinner.” She continues to call out to each of the spirits and they stand there confused.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> stands up and uses Persuasion on <em>Gareth</em>, to try and get him to persuade <em>Lord Varkosian</em> to repent. <em>Gareth</em> responds that we are the <strong>Illuminati</strong> they are seeking to destroy.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> casts Mass Cure Wounds so 20 HP for <em>Benjamin</em> and 15 for everyone on he totem. So, everyone gets 35 HP.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> follows <em>Tasbros</em> and appeals to the Wraiths.</li>
<li>I attempt to get <em>Lord Varkosian</em> to repent. He responds that it’s true he killed them all. I tell him his wife is here, she is back and she loves him. He responds that he slew his men and he had to. <em>Wulrif</em> questions him and asks why he did it, he said he was commanded to by the one who holds the book. <em>Wulrif</em> uses Detect Thoughts and he sees <em>Brother Basil</em> with tentacles coming out of his sleeves while he is holding the book we found earlier. <em>Wulrif</em> holds up the book and asks him to repent. Lord responds that we need to destroy the book. Then, he is absorbed back into the sword and it glows bright white. The bodies of the Wraiths suddenly drop.</li>
</ol>
<p>I grab the Holy Avenger and hear <em>Lord Varkosian</em>’s voice in my head “You must wield me to set this right.” He said he will do his penance in this sword until I destroy all sources of evil that led to his downfall. He and <em>Lady Varkosian</em> speak about their past and how they got to where they are now. He said because he is a sword, he is passing his estate onto her. She brings up the fact that he has an illegitimate child. He said it wasn’t his fault, the child’s mother is very manipulative.</p>
<p>I arrange for a proper <strong>Templar</strong> burial. A portal appears and the cathedral is visible on the other side. <em>Wulrif</em> uses Telekinesis to move the bodies through.</p>
<p>I inquire about <em>Brother Basil</em> and the <strong>Magisterium</strong> Initiates come yelling that there is a massive battle occurring ...</p>

<p>We slowly move forward toward the commotion. <em>Viker</em> turns into a fly and investigates what’s going on. <em>Wulrif</em> uses telepathy to transmit her vision to the rest of us. She reports back that she sees a huge battle going on with several globes of darkness that are snatching up initiates with tentacles and dragging them into the darkness. There are 12 globes surrounding a central globe. We see <em>Brother Basil</em> run into the central darkness globe. This is strange because the <strong>Arclight</strong> is active and shining on this area.</p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> readies his action.</li>
<li>I ready my action.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> casts Scatter on us into the central darkness globe. He tried to pull us into the sphere, but we bounced off in different directions. <em>CoralKing</em> landed in one of the spheres. He senses something in there with him. He gets hit twice with slimy tentacles, is grappled, and incapacitated (can’t take actions or reactions). He takes a total of 62 HP damage. He feels like the tentacles are probing around his face and tearing at his skull. He feels that he is close to death.</li>
<li>Tentacles begin attacking the rest of us for 3 HP damage. Suddenly, all globes disappear except the ones near us 4. We notice 2 bodies appear where 2 of the globes were. They are missing the tops of their heads and their brains are missing.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> assumes her normal shape and casts Investiture of Wind (Telekinesis rules), knocking <em>CoralKing</em> out of the darkness.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 2</p>
<ol>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> is no longer incapacitated. He stands up and moves near me.</li>
<li>I ready my action.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> looks at the Warlock’s book and notices some smoke emanating from it. He Uses an Object and reads through <strong>The Book</strong> to Banish the darkness globes. They disappear and each drop a body. The body dropped in the center was <em>Doctorate Julian Yewshade</em>, the Necromancer from the Magisterium, who we tasked with arresting <em>Brother Basil</em> earlier. He continues to investigate the Warlock’s book. He found traces of the Far Realm and decided the creatures who were responsible for this magic were Aberrations. He notices that there is a familiar way these brains are scooped. He finds that they were attacked by Illithids (Mind Flayers) in order to gain their memories. They can’t just appear anywhere, they need some sort of anchor to manifest here. The tome was used to make an anchor, but the anchor is gone.</li>
</ol>
<p>We investigate the city for two cycles to try to find any security breaches, but are unsuccessful. We decide <em>Brother Basil</em> was the one allowing the creatures in. Since he is gone, there is no risk of them returning. I have long Telepathic conversations with <em>Lord Varkosian</em> about this situation. The affair he had, which resulted in a bastard, made him feel guilty enough to drive a wedge between him and his wife. <em>Brother Basil</em> was also strange. He had 2 personalities, a kind one, and a trickster one that was what he used to do his dark activities.</p>
<p>I report for my official swearing in as a <strong>Templar</strong>, and instead of being assigned to a group of 13 (tridectet), I was allowed to maintain my current station in order to keep investigating the <strong>Far Realm</strong> threat. I was told my group might have better skills to solve the issue.</p>
<p><em>CoralKing</em> is slipped a note about joining a brotherhood. I have a Manor on level 5, and <em>Wulrif</em> sets off to work on setting up a Teleportation Circle there, in case we need it. <em>CoralKing</em> finds a note in his pocket. He reads the note and it disintegrates. We ask what it said and he responds “Hello, Brother.”, written in Common. We decide the paper is a wrapper that comes from a machine on level 2. <em>Wulrif</em> locks and protects the area of the Teleportation Circle.</p>
<p>We decide to make our way down to level 2 with the farmers, Franciscan abbey, warehouses, and laborers. <em>CoralKing</em> wants to go to the warehouses and ask the workers if they know of anything about the wrapper he is holding. The worker points out the nearby Paper Mill. He said they wrap food with those wrappers. <em>CoralKing</em> asks if anyone is seeking new members of groups. He hesitates that the warehouse is always looking for new workers, but he isn’t sure it’s a fit for his skillset. He notices some warehouse robots moving about. He goes up to the driver to ask about the robots and is scolded for being in the way. He jumps out of the way just in time. <em>Wulrif</em> looks around for an individual who is paying too much attention to <em>CoralKing</em>, but doesn't notice anyone.</p>
<p><em>CoralKing</em> finds another note in his pocket. He reads it aloud: “4th shift, come alone or don’t bother. He asks when the 4th shift begins, and the foreman responds 1800-2400. So, we travel up to have a nice brunch together. He notices the unintelligible part of the note now reads an address. <em>CoralKing</em> leaves for his meeting.</p>
<p>He approaches the door, and the door slides open. The inside is dark, but he can see. It’s a worker’s quarters and somewhat small. He says “Is there anyone here?” and a voice appears in his head “WTF, why are you screaming?!? You’re supposed to be inconspicuous.” He moves forward and finds himself at the center of the room. He whispers “who’s here?” they respond “We are.” he asks “what do you need?” they respond “What can you do for us?”  “Well, I have a group-” and they cut off “yes, we know about the goodie-two-shoes, but what can you do for us?” he said “anything that is required” “how do you feel about your friends?” “they are my friends.” “We aren't asking you to betray them, but people of our stature don't garner much respect. You've been somewhere we are interested in. It's pretty far beneath us” “What awaits you in the <strong>Underdark</strong>?” “We have business there from time-to-time” “What stops you from entering the <strong>Underdark</strong>?” “What says we don't? You have experience there and that might be useful for our business.” “we will be in touch and you might explain what kind of benefit you provide to our organization. We can give you items and help occasionally,  preventing us from being overlooked. We like what we see of you so far. We will give you something and see you again.”</p>
<p>Suddenly <em>CoralKing</em> sees a ring gleaming on a bed in front of him. “Wait! You say you are overlooked, how would you like to be perceived by others?” “We would like our fair share and certain interests to be looked after. No one else will look after them.” “Is there any way I can help with these interests?” “Of course, once we trust you and are sure it won't cause conflict with your friends.” “Is there anything we have done that is untrustworthy?” “No, or we wouldn't be talking.”</p>
<p>He grabs the ring and slides it in his pocket. He leaves and heads back to the manor. He asks <em>Tysnera</em> if she will investigate the ring for him. She said it appears to be a Ring of Telekinesis, which is very rare. He puts it on, attunes to it, and feels a strange ability now.</p>
<p><em>Wulrif</em> investigates the origin of the book and thinks it originates in a Far Realm diametrically opposed to his Patron.</p>

<p><em>CoralKing</em> doesn’t want to get squished by the Dragon. We decide to investigate the chaos surrounding <em>Brother Basil</em>’s disappearance. <em>Tasbros</em> lets us into the <strong>Magisterium</strong>. Everyone is shocked about <em>Doctorate Julian Yewshade's</em> death, who was well-known and adored. We find the bodies left by the black spheres are strange because there is no signature; they don’t seem to match any clade lines of Illithids that are known. The Chancellor and Provost are busy, so we head to the Department of Necromancy. A Gnome greets us creepily. He tells us the <em>Chair Maeve Shadowdusk</em> is busy and wants to take a message. He directs us to the classroom where <em>Professor Shadowdusk</em> is teaching and we follow. We listen to the lecture about <em>Autumnset</em> and <strong>The Shadowfell</strong>. We speak after she finishes and she expresses how confused she is by the whole <em>Brother Basil</em> situation. She is very concerned about the Illithids ability to cast darkness that is impervious to the <strong>Arclight</strong>. She said <strong>The Shadowfell</strong> wouldn’t be powerful enough to do so, only something from the <strong>Far Realm</strong> would be capable of that. We decide to leave and regroup.</p>
<p>I ask <em>Lord Varkosian</em> about the situation and he says <em>Brother Basil</em> wasn’t the beginning of his downfall, but he definitely contributed to it. He asks if we ever found <em>Basil’s</em> mother. I suddenly remember her and how we never tracked her down. Then, I realize we never asked <em>Lord Varkosian</em> why he became a Death Knight in the first place. He said he felt it was the right thing to do at the time. He said the <strong>Illuminati</strong> wanted him to summon <em>Baphomet</em> to control or consume all beings that were raised from the dead. He said there were more steps in the ritual. They needed an artifact, a gigantic sacrifice, and <em>Baphomet</em>.</p>
<p>We decide to track down <em>Basil's</em> mother in the mines. <em>Benjamin</em> tracks her and we find there was an industrial accident and a lot of people died. However, she went missing outside of <strong>Neverwinter</strong> about 10 cycles ago. It seems that she staged this incident as a breakout. Her tracks change as she moves. That indicates to <em>Benjamin</em> that she is a shapeshifter. She seems to have a set of Drow and a set of Human footprints. We found out that she stole a vehicle when she escaped.</p>
<p>We go back to my <a href="https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/ua/bastions-cantrips/BRF3GSu0nTfNu8p4/UA2023-BastionsCantrips.pdf">Manor</a>, open <strong>The Book</strong> and attempt to read the writings between <em>Brother Basil</em> and his mother. We find out she is a Drow noble and was instructed to bear a child that may have been to create a receptacle for a possession by <em>Llolth</em>. Her last message to <em>Brother Basil</em> is that she is leaving to reclaim her House and Throne. I ask where <strong>Menzoberranzan</strong> is and <em>CoralKing</em> recalls there was a war fought a generation ago between <strong>Menzoberranzan</strong> and <strong>Blingdenstone</strong>. So, the Deep Gnomes might know.</p>
<p>Our new goal is to recapture <em>Brother Basil</em>. We recall <em>Grazillaxx</em> the Illithid from the Society of Brilliance and how it may know what's happening in the <strong>Underdark</strong>. We decide we need to plan and prepare to head back into the <strong>Underdark</strong>. So, prepare spells, prepare teleportation circles, protection, friends, etc. I ask <em>Lord Varkosian</em> if he knows if <em>Brother Basil</em>’s mother was Drow. He said he knew she was elven, but not Drow. She said she was a refugee from her people and he had no reason to doubt her.</p>
<p>I receive an official summons from <em>Lord Commander Sozenskaat</em>. I attend to his office and he passes a letter to me. It reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come at once to <strong>Gauntlgrym</strong> for an audience with <em>King Bruenor Battlehammer</em>, to discuss matters of grave importance concerning your experiences in the <strong>Underdark</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Incidentally, <em>King Bruenor</em> is holding a convention and wants a representative of the <strong>Templar</strong>. By attending I can accomplish both at once. <em>Lord Commander Sozenskaat</em> has procured an airship for our party since <strong><strong>Gauntlgrym</strong></strong> is in the mountains. As it’s getting close to <em>Winternight</em> (when it's too dangerous to fly), we should return by Teleportation.</p>
<p><em>Tasbros</em> and Tysnera are also summoned by the Provost of the <strong>Magisterium</strong>. They were asked for by name by <em>King Bruenor</em> to attend a convention in <strong>Gauntlgrym</strong> within 1 cycle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <em>Wulrif</em> is researching guides to the <strong>Far Realm</strong> to track down the author of <strong>The Book</strong>. He comes upon the Demilich <em>Acerak</em>, an Archlich who travels between worlds and is known to take sick pleasure in devouring the souls of adventurers, whom he lures into trap-ridden dungeons where they suffer horrible deaths. One such dungeon is at the Spine of the World, called the Tomb of the Nine because <em>Acerak</em> slew 9 false gods and sealed their souls within it.</p>
<p>We return to the <a href="https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/ua/bastions-cantrips/BRF3GSu0nTfNu8p4/UA2023-BastionsCantrips.pdf">Manor</a> and suddenly a smell perfuses the room ...</p>
<p>Through the construction of the ballroom, we see 6 globes of darkness. Suddenly 6 giant Duergar appear alongside the globes of darkness.</p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Viker</em>, <em>CoralKing</em>, <em>Tasbros</em>, and <em>Wulrif</em> are grappled. I react and hit the creature for 27 damage, killing it!</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> is no longer grappled. She readies her action.</li>
<li>Tentacles come out of the globes and <em>Viker</em>, <em>Tasbros</em>, and me all take 24 damage. Everyone else takes 12. <em>Tasbros</em> took 35 damage on the next attack, everyone else takes 17. The remaining tentacles deal 20, 16, 16, &amp; 20 Hit Points of psychic and cold damage. <em>Tasbros</em> goes down.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> is still grappled.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> is no longer grappled, and heals himself.</li>
<li>I make a Vow of Enmity and attack 2 Duergar, killing them.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> casts misty step and scatter on us, so we are all outside the building now. He yells “close the door!”</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 2</p>
<ol>
<li>The Duergar rush the door and fail to shove through me.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> enables her unicorn totem. Everyone is healed 30 HP.</li>
<li>2 tentacles lash through us. I took 60 HP damage and all the Dwarves are killed by them.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> recovers</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> shuts the door and barricades it with his ring of telekinesis.</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em></li>
<li>I heal myself</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> went to the book to banish these creatures and he hears 4 popping sounds.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 3</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Viker</em> heals everyone 41 HP.</li>
<li>I prevent something from opening the door again.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> casts Bigby's hand to keep the door closed and I help him.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> uses his telekinetic ring to hold the door</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> heals himself and</li>
<li>I hold the door</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> tries again to banish the creatures, but they persist.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 4</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Viker</em> readies her action.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> and I hold the door against another attack.</li>
<li><em>Wulrif</em> banishes the rest of the creatures. He notes the location of the specialized banish spell in this book for future use.</li>
</ol>
<p>We want to meet with the Dwarven King next chance.</p>

<p>We all hop on the airship to the <strong>Gauntlgrym</strong> mine. As we rise above the clouds, we can feel the changing of the season. From the deck of the airship, we watch the <em>Enclouding</em> dissipate into the wide blue skies of <em>Autumnset</em>, surmounted by the <em>Arch</em>.
We ponder the dangers of the upcoming <em>Winternight</em>.</p>
<p>The great gate of <strong>Gauntlgrym</strong> is huge. There are tons of Dwarves, tons of levels with twisting stairs, and passageways that Dragons could walk through. The whole place feels old and variably lit. Mine carts run by themselves. There are a couple of people on our ship that I don’t recognize.</p>
<p>We are kindly greeted at the gate and led to our quarters. Out of the corner of <em>Actias</em>’ and <em>Wulrif</em>’s eyes, they see Ghosts. We are told they won’t mess with us as long as we don’t desecrate the locations of their demise. We are also told to avoid the <strong>Iron Tabernacle</strong>, the cathedral. They said the king will see us when we have rested from our travels. We decide to short rest.</p>
<p>We are taken to meet a red-haired Dwarf and the magic users can feel a strong divine magic. I can feel a consecrated magic. He says “welcome friends, I want to know about the depths outside my city.” So, he discern that he wants to know about the <strong>Underdark</strong>. We tell him about  the Koa-Toa summoning <em>Demogorgon</em>. We attempted to stop it, but failed and were forced to flee. We continued to update him on all of our travels until this point.</p>
<p>He said he recently reclaimed the kingdom from the Illithids. He said in the deeper levels, we shouldn't trust what we find. It’s rumored there is some sort of primordial creature guarding the lower levels. The weapons forged there are superior.</p>
<p>We remember the book <em>Wulrif</em> has can be a clue to <em>Basil</em>. So, we think if we can find his Patron, we might be able to find which realm he’s in. We figure out how to take a magical sleep to find him. In the meantime, we are summoned to dinner by some Dwarves. We are approached by a wealthy young lady who says she wants to speak with us privately. She walks away and we discuss if we should. We decide we should and follow her into a massive room off of the great hall.</p>
<p>She confirms that we are from <strong>Neverwinter</strong> and says we can trade information. She said she is from the <em>Zhentarim</em>. She wants to know the information that <em>King Bruenor</em> gives us, that he hasn’t given her. We agree and she leaves. We meander back to the feast and are met by a Dwarf that tells us the king wants to meet with us privately.</p>
<p>We follow the Dwarf again as he leads us down a labyrinth of halls. The king said he relayed our information and he wants to know more. He instructs us to find a people, who can lead us to a place, and they might give us some information. He said he will support us along the way.</p>
<p>We all stock up on various equipment and head out. We see snow falling on the mountains and feel the cold air. It’s perfectly dark outside. Our first few cycles are uneventful. Eventually, we suddenly encounter 8 trolls. <em>Benjamin</em> and I are surprised, while the rest of us aren’t.</p>

<p>Round 2 (continued from last session)</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> takes 32 HP damage on a Troll bite. <em>CoralKing</em> takes 36 HP damage. Wulrif takes 36 HP damage. Then, takes another 48 HP more. <em>Viker</em> is attacked and takes 36 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> uses a Flurry of Blows and his Staff of Striking to attack one of the creatures. He does 46 HP damage.</li>
<li>I cast Spirit Shroud and hit a Troll twice for 56 HP damage, killing it!</li>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> calls <em>Tysnera</em> and <em>Tasbros</em> to come help us. <em>Tysnera</em> and <em>Tasbros</em> Teleport to my Sending Stone.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> and <em>Tasbros</em> take ice damage as they land near an Ice Troll. <em>Tasbros</em> casts Wall of Fire affecting the enemies in a straight line and does 34 HP damage to each of them.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> also casts Wall of Fire and does 32 HP damage to each of them.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> kills a Troll and hit another for 22 HP damage.</li>

<p>Round 3</p>
<ol>

<li><em>Viker</em> casts Plane Shift, makes a melee attack, and a Troll banishes.</li>

<li>One of the creatures drops dead from the flames.</li>
<li>Wulrif hits a Troll, almost knocking it over. He takes another 36 HP damage though.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> uses Magic Missile on the last Troll and does 22 HP damage, killing it.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> manages to climb up the hill on his own.</li>
</ol>
<p>We smell burning Troll and <em>Benjamin</em> tracks the Trolls back to a cave they were covering up. There's a strong blizzard swirling around us, so we walk up their driveway. In this cave, we see a bunch of stuff strewn about. We find copper, silver, gold, and platinum coins:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copper - 900</li>
<li>Silver - 600</li>
<li>Gold - 1500</li>
<li>Platinum - 70</li>
</ul>
<p>We also find a magical bag containing a spell scroll and a potion. <em>Tasbros</em> uses Mage Hand to grab the bag and gives it to <em>Actias</em>. <em>Tysnera</em> discovers a Potion of Fire Breath and a spell scroll of Sleet Storm. We spend 3 cycles in this cave as the storm passes. Eventually, after six more cycles of trekking to the <strong>Surbrin Hills</strong>, <em>Daavra</em> leads us to a cave that is the entrance to the <strong>Underdark</strong>.</p>
<p>We follow <em>Daavra</em> through the <strong>Underdark</strong> and our first cycle back underground uneventful. Then, on the 2nd cycle we enter a large cavern with a crevice about 20 feet wide. <em>Actias</em> casts Arcane Gate to let us across safely. Next cycle, we see a new clearing with glowing fungi and a foul smell. We are able to gather that this is also a large cavern. <em>Benjamin</em> investigates and finds 10 creatures shaped like centipedes with tentacles. There was a big battle and these creatures are eating the remnants. <em>Viker</em> casts Pass Without Trace, we gather around her, and slowly make our way around and past these creatures. Later, we make camp and rest. A gang of Hobgoblins ambush us. <em>Benjamin</em> screams &quot;Wake Up!&quot; and we all jump up and prepare for battle.</p>
<p>Round 1</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> holds her action.</li>
<li><em>CoralKing</em> walks over to the Hobgoblins and he can see 3 bands of Hobgoblins ready to attack.</li>
<li><em>Actias</em> moves out of his tent, Misty Steps to one band of Hobgoblins, and casts Blur.</li>
<li>Another one of the bands of Hobgoblins surrounds <em>CoralKing</em> and he gets hit twice for 26 HP damage. <em>Actias</em> gets hit for 52 HP too.</li>
<li>I Misty Step 30 feet, walk to the leader of the Hobgoblins, and hit him twice for 18 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Tasbros</em> summons a Draconic Spirit (Chromatic) and it attacks the 2 Hobgoblins next to his tent. The dragon attacks them for 17 HP, dropping one. <em>Tasbros</em> takes 3 HP damage and the other Hobgoblin takes 7 HP damage.</li>
<li><em>Viker</em> casts Call Lightning and does 27 HP damage on 3 Hobgoblins, killing them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Round 2</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Benjamin</em> Stone Skins me.</li>
<li><em>Tysnera</em> casts Maximized Fireball and slaughters all of the Hobgoblins in the radius. The large one takes 60 HP damage to the face.</li>
<li>The large one speaks Common to me and says “Parlay.”</li>
</ol>
<p>He said he will help us travel around the creatures in this area through the next bend if we don’t kill him. I ask <em>Daavra</em> what she thinks and she says he can probably help us, and we can dispose of him if we need to. I agree and we take a rest.</p>
